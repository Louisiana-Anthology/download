          which sailed from Havana the 16th of October, 1780, against
          Pensacola, having been frustrated by the hurricane, its
          Commander Dn. Bernardo de Galvez, returned to the sailing
          port, November 17th, with the sorrow of ignoring the
          whereabouts of the ships of his escort, some of which
          dispersed by the storm, went to Campeche, others to the
          Mississippi River, a few to other places, and it is believed
          that one perished, for nothing is known of its fate. After his
          arrival in Havana the referred to General reiterated his
          former pretentions that the fort of Mobile be succored with
          provisions and men, not only because it found itself very
          short of these, but also because it threatened to be attacked.
          In view of his insistence, the Council of Generals ordered
          that two ships be prepared capable of transporting 500 men and
          some provisions, and this small convoy made sail the 6th of
          December under command of the Capitan of frigate Dn. Joseph de
          Rada; notwithstanding that after a few days navigation, he
          arrived safely at the mouth of the Mobile, he determined not
          to enter its bay on account having found (so he assured) some
          variation in the channel, and he made sail directly for the
          Baliza of the Mississippi River at the entrance of which he
          left the convoy and returned to Havana.</p>

          of the village had been attacked, moved Dn. Bernardo de Galvez
          to urge, that although the state of things did not permit a
          renewal of the expedition from Havana, some troops be given
          him with which to reinforce the garrisons of Louisiana and
          Mobile and from there, if a favorable opportunity were found,
          pledge the inhabitants of those regions to a further effort
          and fall on Pensacola, or if this could not be, preserve more
          securely what had been conquered. The idea having been
          approved by the Council of Generals, it was resolved to select
          1315 men from the various regiments, including five companies
          of grenadiers and to provide for the equipment of vessels as
          transports, and designating as a guard for these, the ship of

          the morning the convoy sailed, so happily, that, by three in
          the afternoon, the ships were all a great distance from the
          Port of Havana. The General had previously sent Capitan D.
          Emiliano Maxent in a schooner to New Orleans with orders to
          the Commandant of Arms, so that the troops that D. Joseph Rada
          had left and those that had arrived on account of the October
          storm should set out and meet the convoy, and to that end had
          already advised under date of February 1st, that they find

          informs him of his intention of proceeding to the East of

          the morning, all the commanders of the war vessels came aboard
          the commanding ship, and the General informed them of his
          project of proceeding to the Island of Santa Rosa,
          disembarking thereon and attacking the battery the enemy had
          on Siguenza Point, so as to facilitate the entry of our ships
          in the Port, without the risk of passing through a cross fire,
          and there await the reinforcements from Louisiana and Mobile.
          All the officers of the Fleet applauded this thought and some
          amongst them earnestly solicited the honor of entering first.
          At 10 o'clock eleven vessels were sighted to windward, which
          were chased until nightfall, and by their direction they
          seemed to be making Tortugas Sound, and were thought to be a

          well understood that the grenadiers and light infantry should
          be the first to disembark, and that they should pass by the
          stern of the ship S. Ramon, when two lights should appear
          thereon. At the hour of Prayer the convoy came to anchor at a

          the boats with troops should gather there, and the General
          having placed himself at their head, the landing was effected
          with some misgivings, but without the least opposition. He
          gave his orders to Colonel D. Francisco Longoria to take up
          the march with the grenadiers and light infantry and returned
          to the ship to hasten the final disembarking, so that by 3
          o'clock in the morning of the 10th all the troops were

          letter from the Commander of the sea forces in which he
          described the great difficulties he found, even after having
          consulted with the officers of his squadron, in risking the

          engaged were surrounded on all sides by a class of enemies
          whose real advantage consists in never coming out from the
          cover of the woods, adopted the plan to attack them with a few
          companies of light infantry, and with the assistance of two
          field pieces, this maneuver not only obliged the Indians to
          retire precipitately, but also compelled the English troops
          who supported them to retire to the shelter of Fort George, so

          the great number of trees that had been cut and pits that had
          been dug from place to place, for which reason, and also
