<p class=Style14ptJustified><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>
<font size="4">René</font></span></i><font size="4"><span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>,</span> which
first appeared in 1802, had an immediate impact comparable to that of Goethe’s <i>The
Sorrows of Young Werther</i>. Like the German novel, it dealt with a sensitive
and passionate young man at odds with contemporary society. <i>René</i> was
first published as part of Chateaubriand’s <i>Génie du christianisme,</i> which
also contained another novella, <i>Atala</i> (the tale of the Natchez Indian
Chactas’s doomed love for the Christian half-caste girl Atala) though <i>René</i>
was in fact an excerpt from a long prose epic the author had composed between
1793 and 1799 called <i>Les Natchez</i>, which would not be published until
1826. <i>René</i> enjoyed such popularity that it was republished separately,
with <i>Atala,</i> in 1805. Neither novella exalts the ‘noble savage’, instead
implying that positive values are more or less synonymous with Christianity and
Europeanization. Nevertheless the ‘savages’ are treated with sympathy and
respect, and Chateaubriand’s attitude to the primitive versus the civilised is
therefore often misunderstood. As the title hints, there are autobiographical
elements in the book, drawing on Chateaubriand’s memories of his childhood in 
<st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>
and travels in <st1:place>North America</st1:place> in 1791. Chateaubriand
attracted criticism for his use of the incest theme, but <i>René</i> inspired
the young, for whom it expressed the <i>mal du siècle </i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>experienced by</span> their generation.
René’s travels through <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> were imitated by Byron in <i>Childe
Harold’s Pilgrimage </i>both protagonists being restless outsiders with a
certain contempt for the banality of the world. Yet in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>René</i> we also hear the tones of the profound moralist and natural
philosopher, writing in a limpid style which is heard again in all its fullness
and beauty in the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mémoires</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> <span class=SpellE>d’outre</span> <span
class=SpellE>tombe</span></i>. </font> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">          </font> </span>
<font size="4">Once among
the <st1:City><st1:place>Natchez</st1:place></st1:City>, René was obliged to
take a wife, to conform to the ways of that American Indian people; but chose
not to live with her. A tendency to melancholy drew him into the woods; he
spent whole days there alone, and seemed a savage among the savages. Except for
Chactas, his adopted father, and Père Souël, the missionary at Fort-Rosalie he
renounced all relations with mankind. These two elderly men had won much
influence over his feelings: the former by his friendly indulgence, the latter,
in contrast, by his unrelenting severity. Since the beaver-hunt, during which
the blind Sachem had told his story to René, the latter had not wished to speak
of his own. However Chactas and the missionary had a strong desire to know by
what misfortune a European nobleman had been led to the strange resolution of
burying himself in the wilds of <st1:State><st1:place>Louisiana</st1:place></st1:State>.
René had always given as justification for his refusal, the limited interest to
be found in his history which was confined, he said, to that of his thoughts
and feelings. ‘As for the events which led me to sail for <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>’,
he added, ‘I would wish to bury them in eternal oblivion.’</font><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">          </font> </span>
<font size="4">Some years
passed by in this regard, without the two old men being able to wrest his
secret from him. A letter he received from <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>, through
the Society of Foreign Missions, added to his sadness to such a degree that he
fled to his two old friends. They were only the more eager in exhorting him to
open his heart to them. They showed so much discretion, tenderness and
authority, that he was forced in the end to satisfy their desire. He therefore
spent time with them, not in recounting the story of his life, since he had
experienced little, but the secret sentiments of his soul. </font> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">          </font> </span>
<font size="4">On the
twenty-first of that month, which the Savages call <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>the moon of flowers</i> (May), René took himself to Chactas’s hut. He
gave his arm to the Sachem, and led him beneath a sassafras tree on the banks
of the <st1:State><st1:place>Mississippi</st1:place></st1:State>. Père Souël was
not long in arriving at the rendezvous. Dawn was breaking: some distance away
in the plain, the village of the <st1:Street><st1:place>Natchez</st1:place></st1:Street>
could be seen, with its grove of mulberries and its huts resembling bee-hives. The
French colony and Fort-Rosalie were visible to the right, along the
river-banks. Tents, half-built houses, the foundations of fortifications,
clearings full of Negroes, clusters of Whites and Indians, served to provide a
contrast between the social and savage ways of life, in the one small
space.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Towards the east, in the background,
the sun was rising among the jagged peaks of the <st1:place>Appalachians</st1:place>,
drawn like figures of azure on the golden reaches of sky; in the west, the 
<st1:State><st1:place>Mississippi</st1:place></st1:State>’s
waves rolled by in magnificent silence, and with inconceivable grandeur formed
a boundary to the picture.</font><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">          </font> </span>
<font size="4">The young man
and the missionary spent a while admiring this striking scene, the Sachem lamenting
his inability to enjoy it; then Père Souël and Chactas seated themselves on the
grass at the foot of the tree; René took his place between them, and after a
moment’s silence, he spoke to his companions as follows:</font><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">          </font> </span>
<font size="4">‘In beginning
my tale, I cannot avoid a brief moment of shame. The tranquillity in your
hearts, that of venerable men, and the calm of nature around me make me blush
for the turmoil and agitation within my soul.</font><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">          </font> </span>
<font size="4">How you must
pity me! How wretched my eternal disquiet must seem to you! You who have
exhausted all the sorrows of life, what can you think of young man without
strength or virtue, who finds his own torment in himself, and can only complain
of ills he himself has engendered? Oh, do not condemn him; he has been punished
more than enough! </font> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">          </font> </span>
<font size="4">I cost my
mother her life in bringing me into the world; I was cut from her womb. I had a
brother whom my father blessed, because he was the eldest son. As for me,
delivered at the outset to the hands of strangers, I was raised far from the
paternal roof.</font><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">          </font> </span>
<font size="4">By
temperament I was impetuous, my character inconsistent. By turns loud and
joyful, silent and sad, I gathered young companions round me; then, abandoning
them suddenly, would sit in solitude, contemplating the fugitive clouds, or
listening to the rain falling on the leaves.</font><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">          </font> </span>
<font size="4">Every autumn,
I returned to the paternal chateau, situated among forests, beside a lake, in a
remote province.</font><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">          </font> </span>
<font size="4">Timid and
constrained in front of my father, I found ease and contentment only with my
sister Amélie. A similar gentleness in temperament and taste bound me closely
to that sister; she was a little older than me. We loved to climb the hills
together, sail the lake, and traverse the woods when the leaves were falling:
walks whose memory still fills my soul with delight. O you enchantments of
childhood and its haunts, will you ever lose your sweetness?</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">          </font> </span>
<font size="4">Sometimes we
walked in silence, giving ear to the dull soughing of autumn, or the sound of
the dead leaves, which we trod sadly under our feet; sometimes, in our innocent
games, we pursued the swallows over the meadows or the rainbow on the glistening
hills; sometimes too we murmured verses inspired by the spectacle of nature.
Young, I cultivated the Muses; there is nothing more poetic, in the freshness
of its passions, than a sixteen year old heart. The dawn of life is like the
dawn of day, full of purity, visions and harmonies. </font> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">On
Sundays and holidays, in the vast woods, I often heard the sound of distant
bells through the trees, calling the toilers in the fields to prayer. Leaning
against the trunk of an elm, I listened in silence to their pious
reverberations. Each quiver of the bronze carried to my naïve soul the
innocence of rustic manners, the calm of solitude, the charm of religion, and
the delightful melancholy of the memories of early childhood. Oh who, however
ill constituted, has not shivered as the bells of his birthplace sounded; those
bells which trembled with joy over his cradle, which announced his arrival in
this world, which attended the first beats of his heart, which announced his father’s
sacred happiness to the whole neighbourhood, the yet more ineffable sorrows and
joys of his mother! All is there in the enchanted reveries into which the sounds
of those bells of home plunge us: religion, family, country, the cradle and the
grave, the past and the future.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">It
is true that Amélie and I enjoyed more of these solemn and tender ideas than
others, because we both possessed a degree of sadness in the depths of our
hearts: we inherited that from </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span class=GramE><font size="4">our</font></span><font size="4"> mother, or from God.
</font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">However
my father was suffering from an illness which not long after led him to the
grave. He expired in my arms. I learnt to know death from the lips of him who
gave me life. The impression was powerful; it still endures. It was the first
occasion on which the soul’s immortality presented itself clearly to my eyes. I
could not believe that inanimate body was the creator of thought within me; I
felt it must have reached me from another source; and in a state of holy sorrow
almost akin to joy, I hoped one day to rejoin my father’s spirit. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Another
phenomenon confirmed that exalted idea in me. My father’s features in the
coffin had taken on something of the sublime. Why should that astounding
mystery not be an indication of our immortality? Why should death, that knows
all, not etch on the brow of its victim the secrets of another universe? Why
should there not be, in the grave, some vast vision of eternity?</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Amélie,
overcome with grief, retired to the confines of a turret, where beneath the
arches of the Gothic chateau she heard the chanting of the priests as they
walked in procession, echoing with the sound of the funeral bell.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
accompanied my father to his last refuge; the earth closed over his remains;
eternity and oblivion bore down on him with all their weight; by evening
indifferent feet passed his grave;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>except for the memories of his daughter and his son it was already as
though he had never existed.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">It
was necessary to quit the paternal roof, now part of my brother’s inheritance:
I went with Amélie to live with elderly relatives.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Hesitating,
at the threshold of various illusory paths of life, I considered them one by
one, without daring to pursue any one of them. Amélie often spoke to me of the
virtues of the religious life; she told me I was the sole tie that bound her to
the world, and she fixed her sad gaze on me.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">My
heart moved by these conversations full of piety, I often wandered towards a
monastery, close to my new residence; for a time I was even tempted to hide my
life away there. Happy are those who have ended their voyage without leaving
port, and have not, as I have, dragged out useless days on this earth!</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">We
Europeans endlessly agitated are forced to build solitudes for ourselves. The
more turbulent and noise-filled our hearts, the more silence and calm attract
us. Those hospices in my land, which are open to the poor and weak, are often
hidden in valleys which inspire in the heart vague feelings of distress and
hope of shelter; sometimes one finds them placed on the heights where the
religious soul, like a mountain plant, seems lifted to the sky to offer up its
fragrance. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
can still see the majestic blend of woods and water around that ancient abbey
where I thought of ridding my life of the vagaries of fate; at twilight I still
inhabit those solitary echoing cloisters. When the moon half-lit the pillars of
the arcades, and threw their shadows on the opposite walls, I would stop to
contemplate the cross which marked the cemetery, and the long grass which grew
between the tombstones. O men who, having lived far from the world, had passed
from the silence of life to the silence of death, with what disgust for this
earth did your graves not fill my heart! </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Either
a temperamental restlessness, or a prejudice against the monastic life, led me
to alter my intentions; I resolved to travel. I said farewell to my sister; she
grasped me in her arms with an emotion that resembled joy, as if she were pleased
to see me leave; I could not help reflecting bitterly on the frailty of human
relationships.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Nevertheless,
full of eagerness, I hurled myself into the stormy ocean of this world, knowing
nothing of its harbours or its hazards. I first visited those nations that no
longer exist; I went to sit among the ruins of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and <st1:City><st1:place>Rome</st1:place></st1:City>: places long-remembered
for human strength and ingenuity, where palaces are buried in dust, and the
mausoleums of kings and emperors are lost among briars. The forces of nature
and the feebleness of man: a weed often pierces the solid marble of those

a tall pillar appeared standing solitary in the wilderness, as a mighty thought

</font> </span><font size="4">I
meditated on those monuments among all the incidents, and at every hour, of the
day. Sometimes the same sun that had seen the foundations of those cities laid,
set majestically, to my view, among their ruins; sometimes the moon rising in a
clear sky, between two half-shattered cinerary urns, showed me pale tombstones.
Often by the light of that star that feeds our reveries, I thought I saw the
Spirit of Memory, sitting pensively by my side. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">

I grew tired of rummaging among coffins, where many a time I disturbed only the
ashes of crime.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
wanted to see if living races might reveal to me more of virtue, or less of
vice, than those which had vanished, As I was wandering one day in a great
city, passing behind a palace, I saw, in a secluded and deserted courtyard, a
statue (that of Charles I, in London, behind Whitehall Palace) which pointed a
finger towards the site of its notorious martyrdom. I was struck by the silence
of the surroundings; only the wind moaned round that tragic figure of marble.
Workmen were idling at the base of the statue, or whistling as they cut stone.
I asked them whom the statue portrayed: one explained, with difficulty, the
others proving ignorant of the tragedy he recalled. Nothing could have convinced
me more of the true measure of events, and of our insignificance. What has
become of those who once made so much noise? Time has moved on, and the face of
the earth has altered.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
particularly sought in my travels the artists and those divinities who on their
lyre sing the gods and the happiness of nations that honour law, religion and
the dead. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Those
singers are of a divine race, they possess the only incontestable gift that
heaven has granted to earth. Their life is at once naive and sublime; they
celebrate the Gods with golden tongues, and are the simplest of men; they speak
like immortals or little children; they explain the laws of the universe, and yet
cannot understand the most innocent affairs of life; they have marvellous ideas
concerning death, and dying, without being aware of it, like infants.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">In
the mountains of <st1:place>Caledonia</st1:place>, the last bard to be heard
among those wilds sang those poems to me with which a hero once solaced his old
age. We were seated on a quartet of stones eaten away by lichen; a torrent
flowed at our feet; deer grazed some distance away among the ruins of a tower,
and the wind from the sea whistled over the heather of Glencoe. Now the
Christian religion, also the daughter of high mountains, has placed crosses
over the graves of the heroes of <span class=SpellE>Morven</span>, and sounded
David’s harp beside the very stream where Ossian made his harp moan. As
peaceful as the divinities of <st1:City><st1:place>Selma</st1:place></st1:City>
(<span class=SpellE>Fingal’s</span> palace) were warlike, she guards the flocks
in places to which <span class=SpellE>Fingal</span> brought conflict, and she
has spread angels of peace among the clouds inhabited by murderous phantoms.</font></p>

</font> </span><font size="4">Ancient
smiling <st1:country-region><st1:place>Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region> offered
me her host of masterpieces. With what holy and poetic awe I wandered among
those vast edifices consecrated by art to religion! What a labyrinth of
columns! What a train of arches and vaults! How beautiful are the sounds we
hear among the domes, like the sigh of Ocean waves, the murmur of forest winds,
or the voice of God in his <st1:Street><st1:place>Temple</st1:place></st1:Street>!
The architect builds, so to speak, with the poet’s ideas and makes them
tangible to the senses.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">But are
you surprised perhaps, my old friends, you especially, inhabitants of the

of nature?</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">One
day, I climbed to Etna’s summit, a volcano burning in an island’s midst. I saw
the sun rise in the immensity of horizon below me, <st1:State><st1:place>Sicily</st1:place></st1:State>
narrowing to a point at my feet, and the sea stretching into distant space. In
this perpendicular view of the scene, the waves seemed to me no more than
geographic lines traced on a map; but while my gaze perceived these things on
one side, on the other it plunged into Etna’s crater, whose burning innards I
could see amongst black clouds of vapour. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">A
young man full of passion, seated on the rim of a volcano, and weeping over the
mortals whose dwellings he can barely see at his feet, is he not, venerable
fathers, truly an object worthy of your pity; yet, whatever you may think of
René, this scene offers you an image of his character and his existence; it is
thus that throughout my life I have had before my eyes a creation, at once
immense and subtle, an abyss yawning at my side.’</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">On
pronouncing these final words René fell silent, and lapsed suddenly into
reverie. Père Souël gazed at him in astonishment; and the old blind Sachem,
hearing the young man no longer, knew not what to think of his silence. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">René’s
eyes were fixed on a group of Indians travelling cheerfully over the plain.
Suddenly his expression softened and, tears rolling from his eyes, he cried:</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">‘Oh:
happy Savages! Why can I not enjoy the peace that ever accompanies you! While I
traversed so many countries, and so fruitlessly, you sat in tranquillity
beneath your oak-trees, letting the days flow by without counting them. Your
raison d’être is simply your needs, and you arrive, more surely than I, at the state
of wisdom, like children dividing their time between play and sleep. If that melancholy
which is engendered by a surfeit of happiness sometimes seized your souls, you
soon emerged from that sorrowful pass, and gazing at the Heavens, sought out
with emotion the unknown entity that takes pity on a poor Savage.’</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Here
René’s voice again faded, and the young man lowered his head on his chest.
Chactas, extending his arm from the shadow, and taking the arm of his son, called
to him movingly: ‘My son, my dear son!’ At the sound, Amélie’s brother regained
his self-possession, and blushing with embarrassment, begged his father to
forgive him.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Then
the old Savage said: ‘My young friend. The impulses of a heart like yours know
not how to find the level; only moderate that temperament which has already
done you so much harm. If you suffer the events of life more deeply than
others, that should not surprise you; a great soul must of its nature contain
more sorrow than a small one. Continue your story. You have made us traverse a
portion of <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>: let us know something of your
country. You know I have seen <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and what ties bind me to her: I would like to hear tell of that great Chief
(Louis XIV) who is no more, and whose superb dwelling I visited. My child, I
only see with the aid of memory. An old man with his memories resembles some
decrepit oak-tree in our woods: the oak no longer adorns itself with its own
foliage, but it sometimes clothes its nakedness with alien plants that grow
among its ancient branches.’</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Amélie’s
brother, calmed by these words, once more took up the history of his heart: ‘Alas:
my father! I cannot speak to you of this great century of which in my childhood
I have only seen the end, and which was no more by the time I returned to my
native land. Never did a more astonishing or more sudden change affect a
nation. From the heights of genius, religious tolerance, moral virtue,
everything suddenly plunged into spiritual instability, impiety and corruption.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Truly
it was vain to have hoped to find in my own country whatever might calm that
unrest, that ardent yearning which dogs my every step. The study of the world
had taught me nothing, and yet I had lost the purity of ignorance. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">My
sister, her conduct inexplicable, seemed to take delight in increasing my troubles;
she had left <st1:City><st1:place>Paris</st1:place></st1:City> a few days
before my arrival. I wrote to her saying that I intended to rejoin her: she
hastened to reply deterring me from such a project, on the pretext that she was
unsure to what place her affairs might summon her. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>What sad reflections did not occur to me then
concerning friendship, which is warmed by presence, effaced by absence, and
cannot withstand misfortune, far less prosperity! </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
found myself more solitary in my own land than I had been on foreign soil. I sought
for some time to throw myself into a society which had nothing to say to me and
would hear nothing from me. My soul, which no passion had yet employed, sought
an object to which it might attach itself; but I saw that I gave more than I
received. Neither elevated language, nor profound sentiment was asked of me. I
was simply occupied with tailoring myself to society’s standard. Treated
everywhere as a romantic, ashamed of the role I played, more and more disgusted
with men and things, I resolved to retire to the suburbs, and live there
totally ignored. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">At
first I took pleasure enough in this obscure and independent way of life.
Unknown, I mingled with the crowd: the vast wilderness of human beings!</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Often
seating myself in some ill-frequented church, I spent whole hours in
meditation. I saw poor women who came to prostrate themselves before the Lord,
or sinners who came to kneel at the bar of the confessional. No one left such
places without serenity in their expression, and the muffled clamour that was heard
emanating from outside, seemed like passion’s wave and the world’s storm
expiring at the foot of the Lord’s temple. You know, Almighty God, you who saw
my secret tears flow in these sacred retreats, how many times I threw myself at
your feet, begging you to relieve me of the weight of existence, or to alter
the primal man in me! Oh, who has not sometimes felt the need to recreate himself;
to renew himself in the waters of the stream; to fortify <span class=GramE>himself</span>
at the fountain of life? Who is not overwhelmed sometimes by the burden of his
own corruption, and incapable of achieving anything great, noble, or just?</font><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'><font size="4">  </font> </span></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">When
evening came, taking to the paths of my retreat once more, I would halt on some
bridge to watch the sun setting. That star, inflaming the city mists, seemed to
sway slowly from side to side in a golden fluid, as if it were the pendulum of some
clock of the centuries. I retired then, with the night, to a labyrinth of
deserted streets. Gazing at the lights shining within the houses, I entered in thought
into the scenes of sorrow and joy that they illuminated, and reflected that
beneath all those roofs I had not a single friend. In the midst of my
reflections, the hour would strike in measured chimes from the tower of the Gothic
cathedral; the sound would be repeated from church to church, in every tone, at
every distance. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Alas! Every hour spent
in the world opened a grave and made tears flow.<span

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">That
life, which had at first delighted me, soon became unbearable. I grew tired of
repeating the same scenes and ideas. I began to sound my heart, asking myself
what I desired. I did not know, but I suddenly felt that a woodland life would
delight me. There and then I promptly resolved to end, in rural exile, a career
scarcely begun, in which I had already consumed centuries. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
embraced this project with the enthusiasm with which I invested all my plans; I
departed as precipitately to bury myself in some cottage as I had once left to
tour the world. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I am
accused of possessing tastes that are fickle, of being unable to take pleasure
in any one dream for long, of being prey to an imagination that seeks to plunge
into the depths of pleasure, as if overcome by its transience: I am accused of
forever aiming beyond any goal I might achieve. Alas! I only search for an
unknown good, an instinct for which pursues me. Is it my fault, if I find limits
everywhere, if what is finished has no value for me? Yet I feel that I love
predictability in the affairs of life, and if I were still so foolish as to
believe in goodness, I would seek it in the exercise of habit. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Absolute
solitude, the vision of nature, soon plunged me into a state well nigh
impossible to describe. Without parents, without friends, alone on earth, so to
speak, and not yet having loved, I was overwhelmed by the superabundance of
life. I was subject to sudden blushes, and felt as if rivers of molten lava
flowed through my heart; I would give out involuntary cries, and night was as
troubled by my dreams as my waking. I needed something to fill the abyss of my
existence: I descended valleys, climbed mountains, summoning with all the
strength of my desire the ideal object of some future affection; I embraced it
in the winds; I thought I heard it in the sighing of the waters: all things
became that phantom of imagination, both the stars in the sky and the very principle
of life in the universe.</font><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'><font size="4"> 
</font> </span></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">However
this state of calm and disturbance, poverty and wealth, was not without its
charms. On one occasion I took pleasure in stripping the leaves from a willow branch
above a stream, and granting an identity to each leaf that the current carried
onwards. A king who fears to lose his crown in a sudden revolution felt anguish
no deeper than mine, at each accident that menaced those remnants of my action.
O mortal frailty! O infancy of the human heart that never ages! See then to
what childishness our proud reason can stoop! And yet true it is that many men
pin their destiny to things as worthless as my willow leaves.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">But
how to express that crowd of fugitive feelings I experienced in my wanderings.
The sounds that render passion in the void of a solitary heart resemble the
murmurs the winds and water produce in the silence of a desert; one experiences
them, but cannot describe them. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Autumn
surprised me in the midst of these uncertainties; I entered with delight on the
months of storms. Sometimes I wanted to be a warrior wandering among those
winds, clouds, phantoms; sometimes I went so far as to envy the shepherd’s lot,
whom I saw warming his hands at a humble brushwood fire which he had lit at the
corner of a wood. I listened to his melancholy songs, which reminded me that in
every country the natural human singing voice is sad, even when it expresses
happiness. Our heart is an unfinished instrument, a lyre lacking some of its strings,
on which we are forced to render the accents of joy in a tone dedicated to
sighs. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">By
day I wandered on a vast heath bordered by forests. How little was needed to prompt
my reveries: a dry leaf that the wind drove before me, a hut from which smoke
rose into the bare summits of the trees, a patch of moss on the trunk of an oak
shivering in the north wind’s breath, an isolated rock, a deserted pond where
withered reeds sighed! The village steeple, rising far off in the valley, often
drew my gaze; and often my eyes would follow the migrating birds that flew
above my head. I thought of the unknown shores, the distant climes to which
they travelled; I wished to fly with wings like theirs. A buried instinct
tormented me; I felt that I myself was only passing through; but a voice from
above seemed to say: <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>“Man, it is not yet
your season for migration; wait until the wind of death rises, then you will
take flight towards those unknown regions your heart desires.”</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Rise,
swiftly longed-for storms that will bear René into the realms of another life!
So saying, I strode along, my face burning, the wind whistling through my hair,
feeling neither rain nor frost, bewitched, tormented, as if possessed by the
demon in my heart.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">At
night, while the north wind shook my cottage, while the rain fell in torrents
on the roof, while I watched the moon from my window ploughing through banks of
cloud, like a pale ship labouring among the waves, it seemed to me that life
beat twice as strongly in the depths of my heart, that I had the power to
create worlds. Oh, if I had been able to share the strong emotions I
experienced with another! If only, my God, you had granted me the woman of my
desires, and led by the hand to me, as to our first ancestor, an Eve created
from my own being….celestial Beauty, I would have prostrated myself before you;
then, clasping you in my arms, I would have begged the Eternal One to have
granted you to me for the remainder of my life. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Alas,
I was alone, alone on this earth! A hidden languor overpowered my body. That
distaste for life I had felt since childhood, returned with new force. Soon my
heart, no longer provided nourishment for my thoughts, and I perceived
existence as no more than a profound feeling of ennui. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
struggled for a time against this sickness, but with indifference, lacking the
firm resolve to vanquish it. At last, finding myself unable to heal this
strange wound in my heart, which was nowhere and everywhere, I decided to end
my life.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Priest
of the Almighty, you who hear me, forgive a wretch whom Heaven had almost
deprived of reason. I was filled by religion, and yet reasoned impiously; my
heart loved God, yet my mind failed to know Him; my conduct, speech, feelings,
thoughts were mere contradiction, darkness, lies. But does a man always know
what he wishes; is he always certain of his thoughts?</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Everything
slipped from my grasp at the same moment, friendship, the world, my sanctuary.
I had attempted everything, and all had proved fatal to me. Repulsed by
society, abandoned by Amélie, if solitude failed me what remained? It was the
last plank with which I had hoped to save myself, and yet I felt it sinking
into the abyss!</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Resolved
to rid myself of the burden of life, I decided to fix all my thoughts on that
senseless final act. Nothing drove me to it: I set no specific time for my
departure, in order to taste in long draughts the last moments of existence,
and to gather my whole strength, like some ancient, for the moment when I would
feel my soul escape.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Nevertheless,
I thought it necessary to make arrangements with regard to my possessions, and
I felt obliged to write to Amélie. A few complaints regarding her forgetfulness
escaped me, and doubtless I revealed something of the emotion that was
gradually overwhelming my heart. I still believed I had hidden my secret
successfully, but my sister, accustomed to read the depths of my soul, easily
divined it. She was alarmed at the constrained tone of my letter, and at the questions
I posed concerning my affairs, affairs with which I had never before concerned
myself. Instead of replying she surprised me by suddenly arriving to see me.
</font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">To
understand the profound bitterness of my later sorrow, and my first transports
of joy on viewing Amélie once more, you must realise that she was the only
person in the world I loved, that all my feelings were compounded in her with
the sweetness of childhood memories. I welcomed Amélie, therefore, in a kind of
heart’s ecstasy. It was so long since I had met anyone who understood me, and before
whom I could reveal my soul! </font> <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
<font size="4"> </font></span></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Amélie
threw herself into my arms, crying: “Wretch, you wish to die, while your sister
still lives!<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>You suspect her
feelings! Do not explain, do not apologise, I know all; I understand it all, as
if I had been with you. Can I be mistaken, I who witnessed the birth of your
first feelings? It is all your flawed temperament; your disdain; your
injustice. Swear, as I press you to my heart, swear that this is the last time
you will give yourself up to such folly; swear an oath never to attempt your
life.”</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">In
pronouncing these words, Amélie gazed at me with compassion and tenderness, and
covered my forehead with kisses; almost like a mother, or even more tenderly. Alas,
my heart opened again to all those delights; like a child, I wished only to be
consoled; I yielded to Amélie’s power: she extracted a solemn oath; I gave it
without hesitation, not even suspecting that from then on I might be unhappy.
</font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">It
took more than a month for us to accustom ourselves to being together. When in
the morning, instead of finding myself alone, I heard my sister’s voice I
experienced a thrill of joy and contentment. Amélie had received from nature
something of the divine; her soul possessed the same innocent graces as her
body; the tenderness of her sentiments was infinite; in her mind she had only
sweetness and a propensity to dream; you might say her heart, her thought and
her voice sighed in concert; she had the modesty and lovingness of woman,
combined with the purity and harmony of the angels. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">The
moment had come when I would atone for all my vagaries. In my delirium I had
almost desired to experience misfortune, in order to have a real reason for
suffering at least: a terrible wish that God, in his wrath, has granted only
too well!</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">What
shall I reveal to you, O my friends! See the tears which flow from my eyes. How

all is over!</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Yet,
O venerable fathers, let this history be forever buried in silence: let it only
be related here, beneath a tree in the wilderness. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Winter
was ending, when I perceived that Amélie had lost the repose and health she had
first shown. She grew thin and hollow-eyed; her walk was languid, and her voice
agitated. One day I surprised her in tears at the foot of a crucifix. Society,
solitude, my absence, my presence, night, day, everything alarmed her. Involuntary
sighs expired on her lips; sometimes she endured a long journey without tiring;
sometimes she could scarcely drag herself about; she would pick up her
embroidery and let it drop; open a book without the power to read; begin a
sentence she could not complete; burst into tears suddenly; and retire to pray.

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I tried
in vain to discover her secret. When I questioned her, clasping her in my arms,

months passed in this manner, and her condition worsened each day. A mysterious
correspondence seemed to be the cause of her tears, for she seemed more tranquil,
or more troubled, according to the letters she received. Finally, one morning,
the hour at which we ate together having passed, I went to her apartment; I
knocked, but no one replied; I opened the door. I saw on the mantelpiece a
letter addressed to me. I seized it, trembling, opened it, and read what
follows, words which prevent me from taking any joy in the future:</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><o:p><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified align=center style='text-align:center'>
<font size="4">To René</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><font size="4">“Heaven is my witness, dear brother that I would
give my life for you a thousand times over if that would spare you a moment’s
pain; but, wretch that I am I can do nothing to promote your happiness. You
must forgive me then for hiding from you like a criminal; I would be unable to
resist your prayers, and yet we must part….May God have pity on me!</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">You
know, René, that I have always had a leaning towards the religious life: it is
time for me to profit from Heaven’s warnings. Why have I left it so late? God
punishes me for it. I remained in the world because of you…Forgive me; I am
troubled so by the grief that possess me on leaving you.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">It
is now, my dear brother, I feel the need of that sanctuary, against which you
have so often railed. Misfortune separates us from mankind forever; what is to
become then of poor wretches? ... I am convinced that you yourself, my brother,
would find repose in religious retreat: the world offers nothing that is worthy
of you. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
will not remind you of your oath: I know your fidelity when you have once given
your word. You have sworn you will live for my sake. Is there anything more wretched
than always to be thinking of quitting life? For a man with your strength of
character, it is all too easy to die! Believe your sister; it is more difficult
to live. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">But,
my brother, be swift to emerge from a solitude which does you no good; seek
some occupation. I know you mock bitterly at the necessity one is under in <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>seeking a trade</i>. Don’t despise the
wisdom and experience of your elders. It would be better, my dear René, to be a
little more like other men, and thereby experience less unhappiness. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Perhaps
you will find that marriage eases your troubles. A wife, and children, would
occupy your days. And what woman is there who would not seek to render you
happy? The ardour of your soul, the beauty of your spirit, you noble and
passionate air, that proud yet tender gaze, all would guarantee you her love
and loyalty. Oh, with what delight she would clasp you in her arms, and to her
heart! How all her thoughts and glances would be fixed on you, to prevent your
least distress! She would be all love, and innocence before you; you would think
you had found a sister once more. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I am
leaving for the convent of … That institution, built by the sea shore, suits
the state of my soul. At night, in the depths of my cell, I will hear the
murmur of the waves bathing the convent walls; I will think of the walks I took
with you in the woods, when we thought to discover the sounds of the sea in the
agitation of the pine trees’ summits. Kind companion of my childhood, shall I
see you no more? Scarcely older than you I rocked you in your cradle; we often
fell asleep together. Oh, if only the one grave would reunite us some day! But
no: I must sleep alone under the icy marble floor of that sanctuary where those
who have lived unloved rest forever.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I do
not know if you will be able to read these lines half-effaced by my tears.
After all, my friend, sooner or later would we not be forced to part? What need
have I to speak to you of the uncertainty and worthlessness of this life? You
recall young M…he who was shipwrecked off <st1:country-region><st1:place>Mauritius</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
When you received his last letter, some months after his death, his earthly
remains no longer existed, and the very moment you commenced grieving for him
in <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> was the same moment when they ended their
mourning in the <st1:place>Indies</st1:place>. What is man then, whose memory
perishes so swiftly? One group of his friends knows nothing of his death, while
the other is already consoled for it! Ah, my dear, too dear, René, shall my
memory be effaced as swiftly from your heart? Oh, my brother, if I tear myself away
from you in time, it is in order not to be parted from you in eternity.”</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><o:p><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><font size="4">“P.S. I enclose a deed of gift of my property; I
hope you will not refuse me this mark of friendship.”</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><o:p><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><font size="4">A bolt of lightening falling at my feet could not
have caused me more alarm than this letter. What secret was Amélie concealing
from me? What drove her to embrace the religious life so suddenly? Had she not
reconciled me to life by the charm of her friendship only to abandon me in an
instant? Oh, why had she turned me from my purpose? A feeling of pity had
recalled her to me but, quickly wearied by painful duty, she had hastened to
quit a wretch who possessed no one but her on earth. She considered she had
done all that was needed in preventing a man from dying! Such were my thoughts.
Then turning again to myself: ‘Ungrateful girl,’ I complained, ‘if you, Amélie,
had been in my place, if, like me, you had been lost in the desert of life, oh,
you would not have been abandoned by your brother!’</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Yet,
when I re-read the letter, I found something so sad and tender there, that my
heart melted utterly. Suddenly an idea struck me that gave me a little hope: I
imagined that Amélie might have conceived a passion for some man which she had
not dared to confess. This idea might explain her melancholy, her mysterious
correspondence, and the passionate tone which breathed in her letter. I wrote
to her at once begging her to open her heart to me.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">She
was not slow to reply, but without revealing her secret: she merely informed me
that she had obtained exemption from the novitiate, and would take her vows.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
was appalled by Amélie’s obstinacy, the mystery contained in her words, and her
lack of confidence in my friendship.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">After
hesitating a while over what course I should take, I decided to travel to B…in
order to make a last effort with regard to my sister. The countryside where I
was raised lay on my route. When I saw the woods in which I had spent the only
happy moments of my life, I could not restrain my tears, and I was impossible
for me to resist the temptation of wishing them a last adieu.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">My
elder brother had sold the paternal estate, and the new proprietor was not yet
in residence. I reached the chateau via the long avenue of fir-trees; I crossed
the deserted courtyards on foot; I stopped to look at the shuttered or
half-broken windows, the thistles growing at the foot of the walls, the leaves
littering the doorsteps, and the solitary porch where I had so often seen my
father standing among his faithful servants. The steps were already covered
with moss; yellow wallflowers grew between their cracked and uneven stones. A
caretaker, unknown to me, opened the doors brusquely. I hesitated to cross the
threshold; the man called out: ‘Well now, are you going to behave as that strange
lady did who was here a few days ago? When she was about to enter, she fainted,
and I was obliged to help her return to her carriage.’ It was easy for me to
recognise this <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strange lady</i> who, like
me, had come here to search for tears and memories!</font><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Covering
my eyes for a moment with my handkerchief, I stepped beneath my ancestral roof.
I traversed echoing apartments where nothing was heard but the sound of my
footsteps. The rooms were barely illuminated by the feeble light that
penetrated the closed shutters: I visited that in which my mother had yielded
her life while bringing me into the world, that to which my father used to
retreat, that in which I slept in my cradle, and finally that in which
friendship received my first vows in a sister’s arms. All the rooms were in
disarray, and spiders spun their webs over the abandoned debris. I rushed
precipitously from the place; I hurried away without daring to turn my head.
How sweet, but how swiftly fled, are those moments that brothers and sisters
share in their childhood, gathered beneath the wings of their older parents!
The family of man endures but a day; the breath of God disperses it like smoke.
Sons scarcely know their fathers, fathers their sons, brothers their sisters,
sisters their brothers! The oak sees its acorns germinate all around: it is not
thus with the children of men!</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Arriving
at B…, I was guided to the convent; I asked to speak with my sister. They said
she would receive no one. I wrote her a note: she replied, saying that, on the
point of consecrating herself to God, she was not allowed to spare a thought
for the world; that if I loved her, I would avoid overwhelming her with grief. She
added: “However if you intend to appear at the altar on the day of my vows, please
condescend to play the role of my father; that is the only one worthy of your
courage, the only one conducive to our friendship, and my repose.”</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">That
cold steadfastness contrasted with the ardour of my friendship, caused me to
experience a violent emotion. At one moment I was close to retracing my
journey; at another I wished to remain, if only to disturb the proceedings.
That hellish state even prompted the thought that I might stab myself in church,
and mingle my dying breath with the vows that would snatch my sister from me. The
superior of the convent informed me that they had allocated a bench for me in
the sanctuary, and invited me to attend the ceremony which would take place the
following day.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4"><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>At daybreak I heard the first sound of
bells…about <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="10">ten o’clock</st1:time>, in a species
of agony, I dragged myself to the convent. Nothing is more tragic than to
witness such a spectacle, nothing more painful than to survive it.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">An
immense crowd filled the church. They led me to the bench in the sanctuary; I
threw myself on my knees without knowing where I was, or what I might do. The
priest was already waiting at the altar; suddenly the mysterious metal gate
opened, and Amélie appeared, adorned by all of the world’s display. She was so beautiful;
there was something so divine in her expression; that her appearance excited a
feeling of surprise and admiration. Conquered by the glorious sadness of that
saintly being, defeated by the grandeur of religion, all my violent intentions
vanished; my strength left me; I felt myself restrained by an all-powerful hand
and, instead of blasphemies and threats, I found only profound adoration in my
heart mingled with sighs of humility.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Amélie
stood beneath the canopy. The ritual began by the light of torches, in the
midst of flowers and perfumes, intended to render the sacrifice agreeable. At
the offertory, the priest removed his ornate robes, retaining only a linen garment,
ascended the pulpit, and in a simple sermon full of pathos, depicted the
happiness of the virgin who consecrates herself to the Lord. When he pronounced
the words: “She seemed like incense consumed in the fire” a vast calm and
heavenly fragrance seemed to spread through the audience; it felt as though one
was sheltering beneath the wings of the mystic dove; and one might have thought
angels with perfumes and garlands were descending towards the altar, and
mounting again to the heavens. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">The
priest finished his sermon, donned his vestments once more, and continued the
rite. Amélie, supported by two young nuns, knelt on the highest step of the
altar. I was summoned to fulfil the paternal role. At the sound of my nervous
steps in the sanctuary, Amélie was ready to faint. I was placed next to the
priest, in order to pass him the scissors. At that moment I again felt violent
emotion; I was about to give vent to my frustration, when Amélie, summoning her
courage once more, gave me a look so full of reproach and sorrow that I was
dismayed. Religion triumphed. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>My sister
profited from my confusion; she bowed her head bravely. Her beautiful tresses
fell to the ground around her, beneath the sacred blades; a long muslin robe
replaced her fashionable dress, without rendering her appearance less touching;
her troubled brow was hidden by a linen band; and the mysterious veil, double
symbol of virginity and religion, covered her shorn head. She had never seemed
more beautiful. The gaze of the penitent was fixed on the dust of this world, yet
her soul was in Heaven. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">However
Amélie had not yet uttered her vows; and to die to the world it was necessary for
her to experience the tomb. My sister lay on the marble flagstones; a shroud
was draped over her; four torches lit the four corners. The priest, his stole
round his neck, book in hand, commenced to read the Office of the Dead; the young
virgins continued it. O the joys of religion, how great you are, yet how
terrible! <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I was constrained to kneel beside
this dismal spectacle. Suddenly a vague murmur arose from beneath the
sepulchral veil; I leant forward and these dreadful words (which I alone heard)
struck my ear: “God of Mercy: let me never rise from this funeral bier, yet bless
my brother who shared no aspect of my illicit passion!”</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">At
these words, as if escaping from the grave, the awful truth struck me; my wits
wandered, I collapsed onto that shroud, I clasped my sister in my arms, I cried
out: “Chaste bride of Christ, receive my last embrace across the icy wastes of
death, and the depths of eternity, that separate you now from your brother!”</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4"><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My movement, that cry, our tears, disturbed
the ceremony, the priest halted the rite, the nuns closed the metal gate, the
onlookers stirred and pressed towards the altar; I was borne away unconscious. How
little I thanked those who recalled me to life! I learned, on opening my eyes,
that the sacrifice had been consummated, and that my sister had been seized by
a burning fever. She begged me not to seek to see her. O wretched life: a
sister afraid to speak with her brother and a brother fearful of allowing his
sister to hear his voice! I left the convent as if it were that place of
expiation whose flames prepare us for the celestial life, where one has lost
all, as if in the fires of hell, except hope.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">One
can find the strength within one’s soul to fight against personal misfortune;
but to become the involuntary cause of another’s that is almost unbearable.
Enlightened as to my sister’s wretchedness, I understood how she must have
suffered. Now several things were obvious to me that I had previously been
unable to comprehend: that mixture of joy and sadness, which Amélie had
exhibited at the moment when I left on my travels, the care she took to avoid
me on my return, and yet the weakness that prevented her for so long from
entering the convent; undoubtedly the unhappy girl had believed she was cured!
Her intention to take the veil, her exemption from the novitiate, her
disposition of her property in my favour, had apparently generated that secret
correspondence which served to deceive me. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Oh
my friends, I knew then what it was to shed tears, for an evil that was in no
way imaginary! My passions, for long so indeterminate, threw themselves with
fury on their prey at last. I even found an unexpected species of satisfaction
in the fullness of my grief, and I perceived, with a secret feeling of joy,
that pain is not a malady one exhausts as quickly as one exhausts pleasure.
</font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
had desired to quit the earth before the Almighty permitted; it was a great
crime: God had sent Amélie both to save and to punish me. Thus all guilty
thought, all illicit action brings with it wretchedness and disorder. Amélie had
begged me to live, and I owed it to her not to aggravate her sorrows. Besides
(strangely enough!), I had no desire to die now that I was truly wretched. My
grief occupied every moment: so filled was my heart, in the natural course of
things, with trouble and misery!</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">It
was then that I made another sudden resolution; I decide to leave <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>,
and travel to <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
</font>
</p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">At
that very instant, a convoy was being fitted out, at the <st1:place>
<st1:PlaceType>port</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>B</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>…, bound for <st1:State><st1:place>Louisiana</st1:place></st1:State>;
I made my arrangements with the captain of one of its vessels; I made my
intention known to Amélie, and occupied myself with my departure.</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">My
sister had been close to the gates of death; but God, who granted her the
virgin’s palm, refused to call her to Him as yet; her ordeal down here was
extended. Descending for a second time into the painful journey of life, the
heroine, bowed beneath the cross, advanced courageously to the station of
suffering, foreseeing only victory in that struggle, and in an excess of sorrow
an excess of glory. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">The
sale of some property I yet retained, which I ceded to my brother, the lengthy
preparations made by the convoy, and contrary winds, kept me for a long time in
port. Every morning I went to seek news of Amélie, and always returned with new
tokens of admiration and tears. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
wandered ceaselessly around that convent built by the sea shore. At a small
barred window which overlooked a deserted strand, I often saw a nun sitting in
a pensive attitude; she contemplated the face of the ocean on which some vessel
would appear, sailing to the ends of the earth. Several times, by the light of
the moon, I saw that same nun at the same barred window; she gazed at the sea,
lit by night’s luminary, and seemed to be listening to the sound of the waves
which broke mournfully on that solitary shore.</font><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'><font size="4"> 
</font>
</span></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
believe I can still hear the bell that, during the night, called the nuns to
prayer and vigil. While it slowly rang, and the nuns went silently to the altar
of the Almighty, I hastened to the convent: there, alone at the foot of the
walls, I would listen, in holy ecstasy, to the last sound of their hymns,
mingling beneath the vaults of the chapel with the faint sound of the waves.
</font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I do
not know to what extent all these things, which ought to have fed my suffering,
achieved the opposite by blunting its sting. My tears seemed less bitter when I
shed them over the rocks and among the winds. My very sorrow, by its
extraordinary nature, brought with it its own remedy: we delight in that which
is uncommon, even when it proves a misfortune. I even conceived the hope that
my sister in turn would feel less wretched,</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">A
letter I received from her before my departure seemed to confirm this idea. Amélie
complained tenderly of my sorrow, and assured me that time would lessen hers.
“I do not despair of happiness,” she wrote. “The very excess of sacrifice, now
that the sacrifice has been consummated, serves to bring me a little peace. The
innocence of my companions, the purity of their wishes, the regularity of their
life, all provides a balm to my days. When I hear the storm’s roar, and the
seabirds beating their wings at my window, I, a poor celestial dove, think of
the blessing I have been granted in finding a shelter from the tempest. Here is
the holy mountain, the high summit from which we hear the last sounds of Earth,
and the first harmonies of Heaven; it is here that religion gently lulls the
sensitive soul: for the most violent of passions it substitutes a kind of
burning chastity in which the lover and the virgin are united; it purifies our
sighs; it changes a perishable flame to an incorruptible one; it mingles
divinely both tranquillity and innocence with the remains of a troubled
sensuality, in the heart that seeks repose, and the life that seeks retreat.”</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">I
had no idea what Heaven held in store for me, other than to warn me perhaps
that storms would accompany my every step. The order was given for the
flotilla’s departure; several vessels had already set sail at sunset; I had
arranged to spend the last night on shore, in order to pen a farewell missive
to Amélie. About <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, while I was
occupied with this duty, moistening the paper with my tears, I was struck by
the sound of the wind. I listened; and above the storm I heard the guns firing
a warning, mingled with the tolling of the convent bell. I flew to the shore
where all was deserted, and nothing could be heard but the roaring of the
waves. I seated myself on a rock. On one side lay the gleaming waves, on the
other the sombre walls of the convent vague against the sky. A little light shone
from the barred window. Were you there, oh, my Amélie, prostrate at the foot of
the cross, praying that storms would spare your unfortunate brother? The
tempest over the sea, the tranquillity of your retreat; men broken on the
reefs, at the foot of your sanctuary that nothing could trouble; infinity the
other side of a cell wall; the flickering lights of the ships, the motionless
lighthouse of the convent; the uncertainty of the voyager’s future, the vestal
recognising in a single day all the future days of her life; without, a soul
such as yours, oh Amélie, as stormy as the ocean, a shipwreck more dreadful
than that of the mariner; that whole tableau is yet engraved, profoundly, on my
memory. Sun of this <st1:place>New World</st1:place> witness now to my tears,
echo of the American shore that repeats René’s voice, this was the aftermath of
that dreadful night: leaning on the forecastle of my vessel, I saw my native
land vanishing forever from my sight! I gazed for a long while at the last swaying
trees lining the shores of my homeland, and the roofs of the convent sinking
below the horizon.’ </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">When
René had finished telling his story, he drew a paper from his breast, and gave
it to Père Souël; then throwing himself into Chactas’ arms and stifling his
sighs, he left the missionary to peruse the letter he had just handed him.
</font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">It
was from the Mother Superior of… It contained an account of the last moments of
Amélie, of the Order of the Sisters of Mercy, who died as a result of her zeal
and compassion, while caring for her companions who had been attacked by a
contagious disease. The whole community was inconsolable, and Amélie was
considered a saint.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Mother Superior
added that, during the twenty years she had headed her convent, she had never
known a nun of so sweet and equable a temperament or one who was more content
at having forsaken the tribulations of the world. </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">Chactas
clasped René in his arms; and the old man wept. ‘My child,’ he said to his
adopted son, I would that Père Aubrey were here, he radiates a kind of tranquillity
from the depths of his heart, that, while calming others, seems no stranger to
tempests; it appears as the moon does on a stormy night; the wandering clouds
fail to carry it with them in their flight; pure and unalterable, it sails on
tranquilly above them. Alas, for me, everything troubles me and drags me along
with it!’</font></p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">

that moment, Père Souël had listened, with an austere expression and without
proffering a word, to René’s story. He bore within him a compassionate heart,
but maintained an inflexible manner to the outside world; the Sachem’s emotion
led him to break his silence: </font> </p>

<p class=Style14ptJustified><span style='mso-tab-count:1'><font size="4">         
</font> </span><font size="4">‘Nothing,’
he said, addressing Amélie’s brother, ‘nothing of this history merits the pity
you show here. I see a young man, intoxicated by chimaeras, displeased with
everything, who has abandoned his duty to society in order to engage in idle
reverie. One is not, my dear sir, a superior man merely because one sees the
world in an odious light. One only hates mankind and life itself through
failing to look deeply enough. Extend your gaze a little farther, and you will
soon be convinced that all the ills of which you complain are mere nothings. But
how shameful that you cannot recall the one real tragedy of your life, without
being forced to blush! All the purity; all the virtue; all the religiosity; all
the haloes of a saintly woman, render the mere idea of your sorrows barely
tolerable. Your sister has expiated her fault; but, if I must speak my mind
here, I am afraid that, through a dreadful injustice, that confession emerging
from the depths of the tomb has not affected your soul deeply enough in its
turn. Why are you here, alone, in the depths of these woods where you spend
your days, neglecting your whole duty? Saints, you will tell me, buried
themselves in their deserts. They were accompanied by tears and employed those
hours in extinguishing their passions that you spend perhaps in inflaming
yours. Presumptuous youth, to believe that Mankind is self-sufficient!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Solitude is an evil to one who does not view
it under the auspices of God; it redoubles the soul’s power, at the same time
as it deprives it of any object on which to spend that power. Whoever has been
gifted with strength, must consecrate it to the service of his fellow-creatures;
if he fails to use it, he is first punished by a secret unhappiness, and then
sooner or later Heaven inflicts on him some dreadful punishment.’</font></p>

by these words, René, humiliated, raised his head from Chactas’s breast. The
blind Sachem began to smile; and that smile of those lips, unmarried to a
corresponding expression of the eyes, had about it something mysterious and
celestial. ‘My son,’ said Atala’s former lover, ‘he speaks sternly to us; he
corrects both young and old, and he is right. Yes, you must renounce this unorthodox
life which is filled with nothing but sorrow: there is no virtue except in the
paths that others take.</font></p>

day, the <st1:State><st1:place>Mississippi</st1:place></st1:State>, as yet
close to its source, grew weary of being no more than a limpid stream. It demanded
mountain snows, water from the torrents, and floods of rain, and overflowed its
banks, making desolate its delightful shores. At first the proud river revelled
in its strength; but seeing that all was turned to wasteland by its passage;
that it rolled along lonely in its solitude; that its waters were always
troubled; it regretted the loss of the humble course that nature had prepared
for it, and those birds, flowers, trees and rivulets, once the humble
companions of its peaceful flow.’</font></p>

was heard heralding a <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="12">midday</st1:time> storm.
The three friends made their way back to their huts: René, in silence, walked along
between the missionary praying to God and the blind Sachem feeling out his
path. They say that, urged by these two old men, he returned to his native
wife, but without finding happiness with her. He perished a short while later,
along with Chactas and Père Souël, in that massacre of both the French and the
Natchez Indians which took place in <st1:State><st1:place>Louisiana</st1:place></st1:State>.
A rocky seat is still pointed out, from which he used to gaze at the setting
sun.</font></p>
