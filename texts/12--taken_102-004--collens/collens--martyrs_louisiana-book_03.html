448 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
A traitor, who killeth while caressing you ; <br />
And yet how many other men are mild, <br />
Yet brave and true, who scorn a crime ! <br />
<br />
"Tis strange <br />
<br />
Some men have virtue, others vice ; and while <br />
Each beast has some peculiar character, <br />
Man cannot say that he is so or so. <br />
The tiger is bloody, false, and cowardly ; <br />
The lion is bold and generous ; but men <br />
Have souls of various makes, so many <br />
That they not even know themselves. <br />
<br />
But Yillere <br />
<br />
I get no news of him ; what can it mean ? <br />
'Tis now a week since I have sent him hence, <br />
And yet he does not send intelligence ; <br />
No succors do arrive. Why lags he thus 2 <br />
Are the settlements indisposed to join ? <br />
Is he neglectful ? No ! That cannot be. <br />
I know not what to think. <br />
<br />
{Enter MRS. YILLERE.] <br />
<br />
MRS. VIL. Lafreniere ! <br />
<br />
LAF. Madam ! What can bring you here ? <br />
What has occurred ? Your look is full of pain. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Where is my husband, Lafreniere ? <br />
<br />
LAF. Thy husband ! <br />
<br />
Lady, I sent him to the settlements <br />
To gather forces for the army. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Have you got news ? Where how fares my hus- <br />
band? <br />
<br />
LAF. Lady, I'll not deceive you I know not. <br />
Daily I've waited for some messenger <br />
Yet none from him has arrived. I tremble <br />
Lest some accident has befallen him. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Ah ! 'Tis this I have trembled should occur. <br />
Ah ! 'Twas thy unquiet spirit led him on, <br />
And brought thy country into dangers vain. <br />
<br />
LAF. Madam, reproach me not. Do you not teach <br />
Your beauteous daughter, by your precepts wise, <br />
That honor's palm is more, in real worth, <br />
Than the gaudiest diadem which e'er was placed <br />
Upon the brows of shameless votaries <br />
That death is better than a tarnished fame ? <br />
And wouldst thou see thy loved husband, lady, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 449 <br />
<br />
Or I, or any of thy countrymen, <br />
<br />
Bend to a stranger's pride 2 Say, should we live <br />
<br />
To blush to own that we do live ? Ah, lady, no ! <br />
<br />
It cannot be that Villere's wife doth utter <br />
<br />
Words which would make her husband blush to hear. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. True, true. Lafreniere, thou dost speak it right. <br />
Pardon me I am distracted. Heaven <br />
Is witness that I love my husband's fame ; <br />
But I could love him with that fame all lost. <br />
<br />
LAF. Cheer up, good madam ! <br />
<br />
{Enter FIRST SOLDIER.] <br />
<br />
What wouldst thou, soldier ? <br />
<br />
SOLD. A deserter from the Spanish camp asks <br />
For admittance near you. He doth assert , <br />
That he has business pressing and important <br />
To lay before our chief. <br />
<br />
LAF. Bring him to me. <br />
<br />
{Enter a SPANIARD, exit SOLDIER.] <br />
Approach, good fellow ! Art thou from the camp <br />
Of Spain ? <br />
<br />
SPAN. I am ; I hope it will please you, sir, <br />
I'm charged to bear this letter to you. <br />
<br />
LAF. Ha ! Thou God ! It is Villere's writing ! <br />
<br />
MRS. VIL. Villere ! <br />
<br />
Head! Read! Eead ! What does he say ? <br />
<br />
LAF. (reading). " My dear friend : <br />
<br />
To him who bears this I have promised safety, <br />
And from you a rich reward. Garidel <br />
Has proved a traitor ! Plotted with Aubry ! <br />
And since six long days I've been confined <br />
On board a Spanish ship. Console my wife <br />
And gentle Adelaide ! " <br />
<br />
(MRS. VILLERE faints and falls into the arms of the SPANIARD, while <br />
LAFRENIERE exclaims.) <br />
<br />
Eternal God ! <br />
<br />
He has escaped me ! O Aubry ! Aubry ! <br />
Hadst thou but come an hour later ! What can I do ? <br />
I have no prisoners who are worth him ; <br />
I'd have to force the Spanish camp to reach <br />
The ship. My troops are much too raw. Distraction ! <br />
<br />
MRS. VIL. (recovering). Oh, my poor heart ! Thou art quite <br />
hard to burst. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
450 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
(To the SPANIARD.) Where is the ship ? the Spanish ship which <br />
<br />
holds <br />
My husband the man who sent you here ? <br />
<br />
SPAN. A mile <br />
<br />
Below the other camp, and near the shore, <br />
It lies. [Exit MRS. VILLERE. <br />
<br />
LAF. (who has not seen what has passed, but who is still mus- <br />
ing). Yes, that's the only way to save him yes. <br />
To-night, assisted by th' obscurity, <br />
I go, in a well-armed boat, below, <br />
To burn the ship, and save my aged friend <br />
Ah ! Where is the lady gone \ <br />
<br />
SPAN. She went out <br />
<br />
In sorrow overwhelmed. <br />
<br />
LAF. Poor, good lady ! <br />
<br />
She hastes too much to tell the fatal news <br />
Unto her daughter and her friends. Follow ! \_Exeunt. <br />
<br />
SCENE 2. A Spanish ship at anchor in the Mississippi, near the bank / <br />
two boats alongside / sailors lounging in different postures / the sun <br />
setting / AUBRY and GARIDEL on deck. <br />
<br />
ATJB. The fool ! He thinks that bravery alone <br />
Can the Spaniards in this crisis serve. Ha ! <br />
I know a secret path meandering <br />
Through the swamp, by which I can, with every ease, <br />
Bring in his rear half of the Spanish host, <br />
While in his front the other half cloth charge. <br />
<br />
GAR. Ha ! ha ! How will his helter-skelter band <br />
Oppose Spain's compact legions then ? But say, <br />
How has the poison worked ? Did you inquire ? <br />
<br />
AUB. Yes ; while roving about the city's streets, <br />
I met a slave of theirs. The thing works well, <br />
But slowly ; each day a change for Averse is seen. <br />
It will soon break out in all its frightfulness. <br />
<br />
GAR. I saw her use it ere I started thence <br />
Perhaps she does so even now. I felt <br />
A strange pleasure when I saw it. Aubry, <br />
Thou didst discover regions in my soul <br />
Which ere thou cam'st were yet untrodden. Thanks <br />
Be to thee for thy keen perception. I've found <br />
My element ; soon wilt thou see me swimming <br />
In a sea of blood. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 451 <br />
<br />
AUB. (arising). Garidel, adieu, <br />
This hour must I meet O'Reilly he'll not <br />
Be driven off as Don Ulloa was. <br />
To-night I lead the Spanish troops around ; <br />
And to-morrow shall Lafreniere's blood <br />
Stream out with bubbling force, and I shall laugh <br />
To see it flow. <br />
<br />
(He enters a boat.) <br />
GAR. Adieu, good master Aubry ; <br />
I wish thee much success. I'll be with you <br />
If my duty here is done in good time. <br />
I've yet to hang old father Villere ; <br />
<br />
I think he'll not take long to die. Adieu. [Exit AUBRY. <br />
<br />
"Well, now that darkness has commenced, I may <br />
Begin this old rascal's execution. <br />
My men ! To work ! Prepare the rope bring up <br />
That fellow from the cabin. We shall see <br />
How he can dance in air ; from yonder mast <br />
We'll swing him off. Ha ! here he comes ! I'll try <br />
The temper of his soul, in this dread hour, <br />
E'en in its tenderest part. <br />
<br />
{Enter VILLERE, led up in chains.~\ <br />
<br />
Sir Villere, <br />
<br />
Good news I bring you your child and lady <br />
Soon you'll see. <br />
<br />
VIL. O Garidel ! Though thou hast <br />
<br />
Betrayed me, and most ungrateful proved ; <br />
Though thou hast e'en upbraided me for all <br />
The very kindness I've heaped upon thee <br />
Yet I would pardon all, and die with joy, <br />
Could I but clasp them once tyit once again, <br />
With these weak, shackled arms ! <br />
<br />
GAR. Well, then, 'tis gained ; <br />
<br />
Soon will I have thy pardon, benefactor. <br />
Ye'll meet them not with shackled arms, and not <br />
To quit them soon again. Come, will you go ? <br />
<br />
VIL. Indeed ! <br />
<br />
GAR. I do assure you ! <br />
<br />
VIL. (kneeling). I thank thee <br />
<br />
With lowly and confounded wonder, God ! <br />
God of the helpless, receive my fervent <br />
Thanks. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
452 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
GAR. Amen ! <br />
(All the SAILORS together.) Amen ! <br />
<br />
VIL. (rising). Well, Garidel ! <br />
<br />
Do I go now, or when ? <br />
<br />
GAR. Yes, even now. <br />
<br />
YIL. Take off my chains. <br />
<br />
GAR. Not yet ; but ye shall not <br />
<br />
Have them when you meet your wife and child. <br />
<br />
YIL. Well, well, that's all I care for ; say, go I <br />
Within that boat ? <br />
<br />
GAR. No ! By a shorter road. <br />
<br />
(Pointing to the rope prepared to hang YILLERE.) <br />
See ! Yon rope shall bear thee to them. <br />
Thy wife and child will meet thee in the grave. <br />
<br />
(GARIDEL and the SAILORS hurst into a loud laugh.) <br />
<br />
YIL. (after standing a while confounded ). Wretches ! <br />
<br />
{Enter MRS. YILLERE, on the hank.'] <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. My husband ! <br />
<br />
YIL. God ! is this a dream ( <br />
<br />
GAR. No, it is no dream ! 'Tis triumph ! Glory ! <br />
Woman, prepare to see thy husband die ! <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. (kneeling]. Oh, spare him, Garidel ! Oh, remember, <br />
He saved thee when a child from want and death, <br />
He was a father to thee in thy youth, <br />
He loves thee with paternal love ! Oh, stay ! <br />
<br />
Garidel, have pity ! <br />
<br />
GAR. Pity ? I know not <br />
<br />
What you mean. '(MRS. YILLERE faints.) <br />
<br />
YIL. Nay, trifle not so roughly ; <br />
<br />
This can't be serious ; 'tis a cruel play. <br />
<br />
1 will go to my wife ; she awaits me there. <br />
<br />
GAR. Ha ! ha ! The gallows 'tis awaits you, sir ! <br />
Oome, prepare the rope despatch ! <br />
<br />
YIL. The gallows ! (Striking GARIDEL.) <br />
<br />
Slave ! Durst thou thus insult me ? <br />
<br />
GAR. (drawing a dagger). Ha, Yillere ! <br />
<br />
This dagger was given me for thee ! <br />
<br />
(Stabs YILLERE several times.) <br />
<br />
YIL. (falling). God! <br />
<br />
I'm dying ! My child ! My wife ! My country ! (Dies.) <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. (recovering). Where is my husband ? Did he not <br />
call me ? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 453 <br />
<br />
GAR. (steeping a kerchief in VILLERE'S blood). Thy husband, <br />
woman ! Here is his blood ! <br />
<br />
(Throws the kerchief to her.} <br />
MRS. YIL. (staggering). Oh ! <br />
<br />
GAR. Art thou not satisfied ? Go, join him, then ! <br />
<br />
(Fires a pistol at her; she falls and dies.} <br />
(At that moment LAFRENIERE rushes in along the shore, accompanied <br />
<br />
by armed followers.} <br />
<br />
LAF. Stop, murderers ! Ah, ye have done your work ! <br />
But mine begins ! Fire ! (The soldiers fire ; GARIDEL staggers.} <br />
<br />
GAR. (falling}. Lafreniere, I die ! <br />
<br />
But I await thee at the gates of hell. (Falls.} <br />
<br />
ACT IV. <br />
<br />
SCENE 1. LAFRENIERE'S Camp. LAFRENIERE'S tent in the background. <br />
The bodies of MR. and MRS. VILLERE laid out on a litter / <br />
LAFRENIERE gazing upon them. <br />
<br />
LAF. There there is what is left of noble man <br />
And virtuous woman. There Villere lies, <br />
The wise, the brave, the generous a man <br />
Respected, loved ; he had a crowd of friends, <br />
Who shook his hands and clasped him in their arms : <br />
Now they would loathe e'en to put their finger <br />
On his dead, but stately, brow ; they'd stand round <br />
In silence, as if they feared to wake him <br />
From the marble sleep of death, and look on <br />
With eyes and faces which would seem to say, <br />
Can he be dead ? What ! can this be the man <br />
The living man we saw but yesterday ? <br />
To-day, God ! what could have done this ? <br />
By some slight gashes on his side he lieth there <br />
The senseless mockery of what he was ! <br />
And on his human faculties is placed <br />
A seal as lasting as eternity. <br />
<br />
{Enter ADELAIDE, extremely pale and emaciated / he does not see her.] <br />
Thou God ! what will I say to Adelaide ? <br />
I'd tremble 'neath the look of that poor girl, <br />
And feel, though pure, as guilty of a crime. <br />
<br />
ADE. Lafreniere ! <br />
<br />
LAF. Heavens ! What voice is that \ <br />
<br />
No, no, it cannot be thou art not Adelaide ! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
454 POETR Y DRAMA TIC. <br />
<br />
ADE. O Laf reniere ! speak not such dreadful words. <br />
I know it I am no more that beauteous <br />
Adelaide on whom ye once did fix the gaze <br />
Of love ; but though now but the ghost of what <br />
I was the tattered remnant of a robe <br />
Which once was rich and graceful oh, let not <br />
This new deformity drive away the love <br />
Which once was fostered in thy breast <br />
For me ! Oh, make me not loathe e'en myself ! <br />
Know'st thou not thine Adelaide ? Say, has she lost <br />
All semblance to herself ? <br />
<br />
LAF. My Adelaide ! (They embrace.} <br />
<br />
ADE. Laf reniere ! Ah ! well mayst thou look with wide <br />
Astonished eyes upon me. Look, look on ; <br />
But try to look with love and not disgust. <br />
Seest thou these sunken, tarnished eyes this <br />
Deadened skin which leaves the unhealthy flesh <br />
These lips, which thou didst oft compare, whene'er <br />
Amidst the bloom of spring we roved, to every <br />
Crimson flower thou didst pluck these lips, <br />
Like those now withered flowers, have faded too. <br />
<br />
LAF. Nay ; rave not so, my own dear Adelaide, <br />
'Tis only passing sickness thou'lt be well <br />
In some few days. <br />
<br />
ADE. No, no ; believe it not. <br />
<br />
I thought so too ; but I did hear them say, <br />
In whispers which they thought I did not hear, <br />
'Twas poison <br />
<br />
LAF. Poison ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Yes, a cankering <br />
<br />
Drug, well known by its fell workings on me, <br />
Which on my skin perfidious hands have put, <br />
And which will soon (oh, wilt thou love me then ?) <br />
Break out in putrid sores and leaking biles. <br />
Nay, do not seem thus horror-struck. <br />
<br />
LAF. OGod! <br />
<br />
It cannot be, my Adelaide. Who could have done <br />
So infamous a deed ? What hast thou done <br />
Who harmed that one should seek thee out and thus <br />
Deface thy cheek with his polluted hands ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Ah, was it not a wanton crime ? <br />
<br />
LAF. O man ! what can exceed thy wickedness ? <br />
That enemy of every breathing thing, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 455 <br />
<br />
The serpent of the woods, will raise his head, <br />
<br />
Hiss, and shake his rattles at the approach <br />
<br />
Of unsuspecting feet. But man, the greatest <br />
<br />
Enemy of man, rejoiceth in the blood <br />
<br />
Of innocence ; and, while wild beasts destroy <br />
<br />
To get their food, man savage man doth kill <br />
<br />
To kill, and doth amusement find to see <br />
<br />
The blood ooze out of wounds his hand has made. <br />
<br />
And laughs when victims writhe in death's last agony. <br />
<br />
ADB. Ah, Laf reniere, say dost thou love me still ? <br />
<br />
LAF. If I do love thee, Adelaide ? Ask me <br />
If this warm heart still beats ; for till its throbs <br />
Do cease, its highest bound will be for thee. <br />
<br />
ADE. We parted last in anger. 'Twas silly ; <br />
But thou wilt not chide me, Lafreniere, <br />
Though 'twas a jealous whim, for sorrow now <br />
Inflicts the punishment upon me. Think, <br />
I blush to tell thee, some rival enemy <br />
Of thine he cannot be thy rival now, <br />
For thy love hangs not on the flesh as doth <br />
The love of common men yes, that rival <br />
Wrote me this, and I believed it ah, wilt <br />
Thou love me less ? <br />
<br />
LAF. Astonishment ! Yes, yes, <br />
<br />
'Tis Aubry's secret hand with which he wrote <br />
That false perfidious note he once addressed <br />
To Don Ulloa, full of monstrous lies <br />
Against his countrymen. Aubry ! Aubry ! <br />
Thy deeds will soon encounter punishment. <br />
Thou God, turn on him his own faithless arms ; <br />
Bring on him, though not from Lafreniere' s hands, <br />
The lying snares he knows so well to lay <br />
The poisoned blades he can so well direct. <br />
<br />
ADE. (seeing the bodies, but not recognizing). Ah, what ! has <br />
<br />
the war so soon been fatal ? <br />
<br />
Perhaps some orphan o'er each body there will weep <br />
A father slain. Who are they, Lafreniere ? <br />
<br />
LAF. (aside). Thou God, what can I do to ward this blow <br />
away ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Say, were they good and virtuous ? <br />
<br />
LAF. They were indeed. <br />
<br />
ADE. O death ! why dost thou not whose arm <br />
Guides in its rapid flight the fatal ball, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
456 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
Directs the impending sabre where to strike <br />
<br />
Why dost thou not, while ruling o'er the field, <br />
<br />
Select such victims of the battle's strife <br />
<br />
As should be punished by thy bloody scythe ? <br />
<br />
Preserve the father for his anxious child, <br />
<br />
And pierce the heart whose wishes, could they kill, <br />
<br />
Would slay a husband and a widow make. <br />
<br />
Say, had they children ? I would fain console them <br />
<br />
In their pains, for I can feel how strong must be <br />
<br />
The pangs which tear a son's or daughter's soul <br />
<br />
When parted from a father's love forever. <br />
<br />
LAF. My Adelaide, look not so on that dark <br />
Display of man's frail destiny, but come, <br />
For much emotion suits not thy weak health. <br />
Within my tent thou mayest rest awhile. <br />
The travel from the town must have fatigued <br />
Thee much. <br />
<br />
ADE. True. But is my mother there ? <br />
<br />
LAF. Thy mother? <br />
<br />
ADE. Yes. What startles you so much ? <br />
<br />
Where is my mother ? I must find her straight. <br />
She went from home to seek thee, and inquire <br />
If news you had of my father's uncertain fate. <br />
She promised, when she left my filial arms, <br />
In three short hours to be back again. <br />
But what disturbs thy countenance, and shakes <br />
Thy body thus ? Some accident, I fear, <br />
Hath to my mother here occurred. <br />
<br />
LAF. No, no. <br />
<br />
'Tis the humid breath of evening which makes <br />
Me feel unwell. Come, come, let's hasten in. <br />
<br />
ADE. Nay, nay ! I came to seek my mother here. <br />
Where is my mother ? <br />
<br />
LAF. My gentle Adelaide, <br />

Why wilt thou fret so much ? What wouldst thou, girl, <br />
Should happen to thy mother here ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Cruel ! <br />
<br />
Part not a mother from her child. Oh, sir, <br />
What harm has crossed her path ? Shall I not look <br />
Again upon her features kiss her cheek ? <br />
Oh, I pray you by the love to me you've sworn, <br />
Give give me back my mother ! <br />

THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 457 <br />
<br />
Have courage, girl. How can I tell thee all <br />
Unless thou hast a stouter heart ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Oh, yes ! <br />
<br />
I see it now ! Some fatal accident <br />
Has robbed me of her ! Oh, my mother ! <br />
Where O Laf reniere, where is my mother ? <br />
Let me embrace her even if she's dead. (She turns to the bodies ) <br />
<br />
Ha! <br />
<br />
Can it be ! those bodies ! (She runs towards them.) <br />
LAF. Adelaide ! <br />
<br />
ADE. (uncovering one of the bodies). Oh ! (Faints.) <br />
LAF. (taking her in his arms). Too tender maid, canst thou <br />
<br />
withstand this shock ? <br />
Or has it, like the fiery bolt from high, <br />
Destroyed the beating life within thy breast, <br />
And borne thy soul upon its wings to God ? <br />
Halloo, within there ! <br />

[Enter DENOYANT.] <br />
<br />
DEN. Yes, yes, it must be so ; the troops I see <br />
Advancing in our rear are certainly <br />
The promised succors from the country sent ; <br />
They have a martial mien, appear well ranged, <br />
And firm within their ranks. (A trumpet sounds distantly.) Do <br />
<br />
I hear, <br />
<br />
Or are my ears deceived ? A Spanish march <br />
Methinks they sound. I do remember well <br />
The tune. (The trumpet sounds again.) <br />

<br />
MARQ. We are lost ! we are lost ! undone ! <br />
DEN. Friend, what hast thou ? <br />
<br />
MARQ. The Spaniards, on our rear, <br />
<br />
Approach with half their force. See them advance ! <br />
Come, let us haste and arm. {Exeunt. <br />

{Enter LAFRENIERE.] <br />
<br />
LAF. Thank God, she breathes ! <br />
<br />
But, oh ! she will not long survive the hour <br />
Which loosed the band which held on earth the soul <br />
Of parents, whom as much the girl did love <br />

<br />
As the woodland flower doth the earth and shade <br />
By which 'tis nourished and 'neath which it grows. <br />
Once taken from that native soil, it pines, <br />
Nor can attentive hands revive its drooping life <br />
No man-made showers, nor artificial warmth, <br />
Can stop its fading or arrest its death. <br />
\Enter DENOYANT.] <br />
<br />
DEN. See, Lafreniere, see ! the Spaniards come ! <br />
<br />
LAF. Nay, Denoyant ! seest thou not they come <br />
Upon the rear ? How could the Spaniards pass <br />
The morass on our left, the river on our right? <br />
These are doubtless succors, come at last. <br />
<br />
DEN. Nay, sir. Observe their discipline, their dress, <br />
<br />
(The distant trumpet sounds again.} <br />
And listen to that march. <br />
<br />
LAF. My doubts are gone. <br />
<br />
DEN. And Louisiana's lost. <br />
<br />
LAF. Not so, sir ! <br />
<br />
She is not lost ! Are our hands chopped off ? <br />
Are we not Louisianians yet ? <br />
The coming fight will show you, sir, what can <br />
Men, by the love of Liberty impelled, <br />
'Gainst venal hirelings to tyrants sold. <br />

Is marshalling his men. <br />

The chief commander of each regiment. <br />

(Kneeling^ Eternal God ! thou knowest all the deep <br />
Sincerity of this uncorrupted heart ; <br />
And though 'mongst men my bearing has been proud, <br />
Before thy throne I've always humbly bowed. <br />
God ! thou who pourest out, with equal hand, <br />
Into the current of unstaying time, <br />
Joy's limpid stream and sorrow's cup of brine, <br />
Send not to me an unalloyed draught of gall, <br />
But let some sweet be mingled with the pain <br />
Which of late days has fallen to my share. <br />
But if against me only thou art angered, <br />
Then let thy wrath descend on me alone ; <br />
And save my country from the ills which I <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 459 <br />
<br />
Should suffer by thy wisdom's stern decree. <br />
God ! By thy strong will our struggles aid, <br />
And send confusion through the ranks of those <br />
Who make Thy name a frightening password <br />
To the greatest crimes. God, I pray thee for <br />
My country's liberty. Liberty, the gift <br />
Which thou didst give to man e'en from his birth, <br />
Shall it be wrested from his hand to-day ? <br />
Thou didst not destine him for slavery <br />
When thou didst make him like unto thyself, <br />
And stamped him in the holy, perfect mould <br />
Of thine own intelligence and beaut v. <br />
Shall this proud soul which liveth here, and which, <br />
By thine own lungs, was breathed into this breast, <br />
Be cramped within the carcass of a slave ? <br />
It cannot be ! I feel thine impulse now ; <br />
And victory for us will soon make this day <br />
A day of record on our grateful hearts, (ffises.) <br />

Well, Spaniard, what wouldst thou \ <br />
<br />
HER. Dost thou command these hostile bands ? <br />
<br />
LAF. I do. <br />
<br />
HER. I come a messenger of peace. If you <br />
And yours surrender ere the tight, ye shall <br />
Be treated with humanity, and all <br />
Your vain rebellion pardoned. <br />
<br />
LAF. What ! pardoned ! <br />
<br />
Sirrah ! Go, tell your master 'tis in vain <br />
He thinks to cheat us with his futile tricks. <br />
We know how far a Spaniard we can trust. <br />
His rancor can be only cooled with blood ; <br />
His falsehood teaches'him to kill the man <br />
He hates, e'en while he greets him with a kiss. <br />
Go, tell your chief that pardon we ne'er ask, <br />
But from our God for sins against his law. <br />
Pardon, indeed ! We disdain his offer ; <br />

HER. Then must I tell you that without delay <br />
The battle will begin on our part. <br />

LAF. We are prepared. <br />

[Exit HERALD- <br />
<br />
(To the officers.} Is all ready, gentlemen, <br />
To face the enemy ? Can I depend <br />
Upon the bravery and the firmness <br />
Of the men of all your companies ? <br />
<br />
OFFICERS. You can ! you can ! <br />
<br />
LAF. Well, then, the word shall be, <br />
<br />
Charge on for liberty ! When ye return, <br />
And take the head, each of his separate band, <br />
Ye'll tell the soldiers that it is my plan <br />
To break the foe who pens us in the rear, <br />
And then to intrench again beyond them. <br />
Tell them that if we fail in this design, <br />
Our country's lost, and, what is ten times worse, <br />
We lose our freedom, ne'er to get it back. <br />
Try ye to inspire each soldier with a firm <br />
Kesolve to die or to be free. Remember, <br />
That on our arms to-day depends the fame, <br />
The future reputation of our country ; <br />
And on this day we heroes make ourselves, <br />
Or gain the base and ignominious name <br />
Of slaves. Sirs, remember that ! and when ye charge <br />
Upon those Spanish dogs, shout the loud cry <br />
Of Liberty into their ears. 'Twill make <br />
The rascals shrink and fly ; and like the damned, <br />
Whose power fails when saints appeal to Christ, <br />
These slaves will prostrate fall, when high are raised <br />
The voice and arm of patriots unstained, <br />
<br />
For martyrdom prepared. [Exeunt. <br />

<br />
SURG. Lady! lady! <br />
<br />
You need for rest. Why will you leave your bed, <br />
To strain yourself by this exertion great ? <br />
This hard struggle 'gainst your weakness now <br />
Will hurt you much, and may be fatal to you. <br />
<br />
ADE. I pray to God, good surgeon, that it will. <br />
Death cannot come too soon upon me now, <br />
For now he parts me from my parents dear. <br />

<br />
The blow which struck them reached the feeble thread <br />
On which my life doth hang ; and now I'll knock <br />
With arm untiring at the door of Death, <br />
Until he gives me entrance through that gate <br />
At whose dread portal has been left the dust <br />
Of those who were my dearest love on earth. <br />
<br />
(She goes to the bodies; drums beat the charge, firing and shouts are <br />
<br />
heard.) <br />
<br />
SURG. Lady ! lady ! for heaven's sake, retire. <br />
The battle's raging, and some straying ball <br />
May strike you dead. Come ; I will bring you <br />
To some safer place, where, from these flying deaths, <br />
You'll sheltered be. (Firing, drums, and shouts.) <br />
<br />
ADE. Wot so. Here let me weep, <br />
<br />
And call on Death. He'll hear the better here, <br />
For he is near me in an hundred shapes. <br />
O father ! mother ! why are the deadly strokes, <br />
Which fell on ye so lavishly, withheld <br />
From me, whose heart would leap to meet them now ? <br />

<br />
LAF. (throwing away his sword). Go from my hand, thou <br />
<br />
useless trash ! Lost ! lost ! <br />
<br />
Thrice did our soldiers charge, and thrice repulsed ; <br />
They strive in vain to form their broken ranks ; <br />
By myriads stopped, though myriads they have slain, <br />
'Twere vain to try to bring them on again. <br />
In small detachments scattered o'er the field, <br />
They fight surrounded by the compact lines <br />
Of mercenary troops full ten times more <br />
In numbers. God ! God ! Can I not something do <br />
To turn the current of the day ? Ah, yes ! <br />
There there I see a rallied regiment ! (Shouts.) <br />
Nay ! nay ! nay ! poor weakened eyes, they're Spanish troops. <br />
<br />
(Shouts.) <br />
<br />
Yes, ye demons, stretch forth your glutted throats, <br />
Which gurgle with the blood to-day ye've drank. <br />
Let it be heard 'midst hell's eternal fires, <br />
And let the damned reecho up the cry, <br />
Turned to a shout of victory 'gainst God ! <br />
