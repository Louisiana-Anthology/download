Fair colony has, by our gracious King, <br />
Louis the beloved, been surrendered <br />
Unto his Majesty the sovereign Charles <br />
Of Spain. I need not tell you of the greatness, <br />
The clemency and wisdom, of this prince. <br />
Obedience to him is our duty. <br />
Long have I waited with impatience, <br />
That o'er us should begin his rule. At last <br />
My longing wishes are all satisfied. <br />

434 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
O'Reilly, with full powers from his King, <br />
<br />
Ascends the river and will soon be here. <br />
<br />
"Tis true, that moved by futile hope, and strong <br />
<br />
Attachment for the mother country, <br />
<br />
Our citizens did drive good Don Ulloa <br />
<br />
From their native shore ; but of this wrong deed <br />
<br />
They have, I hope, repented. Ambitious <br />
<br />
Factions and discontented men, I know, <br />
<br />
Have, by their cunning and exciting speeches, <br />
<br />
Stirred their noble spirits to rebellion ; <br />
<br />
But quick submission will, I hope, soon show <br />
<br />
That 'tis but a moment's aberration <br />
<br />
Which leads them thus, with folly, to disown <br />
<br />
The will and power of their rightful king. <br />
<br />
LAF. (aside). Base hypocrite ! lying traitor ! <br />
<br />
YIL. Indeed! <br />
<br />
Your Excellence will pardon me, if my <br />
Opinion differs from your own. I think <br />
Our citizens are not thus unsteady ; <br />
Nor are they guided by a blind caprice. <br />
What they have done, was calmly done, and not <br />
In headlong haste. They have resolved to rise, <br />
And desperate resistance to oppose <br />
To the invading horde ; and their honor <br />
They have pledged, at price of blood, to save <br />
Their country from oppression. <br />
<br />
LAF. (aside). Ay, tremble, <br />
<br />
Ye traitors, for they'll keep that sacred oath. <br />
<br />
ATJB. Much does it hurt me to confess the great <br />
Displeasure I do feel, Sir Yillere, now <br />
To find that you, whose discreet judgments have <br />
So often shed benignant influence o'er <br />
This council board, should thus have joined the voice, <br />
The raging of the factious few, whose acts, <br />
Thoughtless and criminal, ere long might bring <br />
An evil scourge upon Louisiana, <br />
And on themselves complete destruction. <br />
<br />
LAF. (aside). God! <br />
<br />
Restrain me, or I'll kill the wretch ! <br />
<br />
AUB. Remember, <br />
<br />
Yillere, that when the Mississippi's wave, <br />
With mighty force, and waters running high, <br />
Threatens to crumble down our feeble dykes, <br />

<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 435 <br />
<br />
The prudent planter seeks to prop the banks <br />
<br />
Or mend the widening breach. I fondly thought <br />
<br />
That you, in this event, would seek to set <br />
<br />
The barrier of your wisdom up against <br />
<br />
The unruly current of this folly <br />
<br />
This rash presumption which menaces now <br />
<br />
To sweep you with it, and destroy you. <br />
<br />
LAF. (aside). Oh, the bribed scoundrel ! <br />
<br />
VIL. Aubry, I care not <br />
<br />
How soon this white head of mine is felled ; still <br />
Persist I in my first opinion. Wisdom, <br />
You say, has until now her breath infused <br />
Into my words ; she has not quit my side. <br />
No factious counsel have I given ; but <br />
The people the whole people have arisen, <br />
And Spain's mercenaries shall dye their swords <br />
In Creole blood, and tread upon an host <br />
Of slain, before they gain the city's walls. <br />
<br />
DENOY. Ay, Aubry ; and I have joined them too, and <br />
Have pledged my honor also with the rest ; <br />
And to redeem the promise I have made, <br />
My sword must triumph in the battle, or <br />
My life be paid a tribute to the grave. <br />
<br />
MILH. And mine ! <br />
<br />
MARQ. (to Aubry). Sir, we'll never yield ! <br />
<br />
DENOY. No, never. <br />
<br />
AUB. Gentlemen ! This is rebellion treason ! <br />
France has made a formal resignation <br />
<br />
CAR. I do deny the right <br />
<br />
DENOY. We all deny it. <br />
<br />
AUB. The people here cannot assume a voice. <br />
<br />
LAF. (to Aubry). Thou liest, dog ! The people will assume <br />
That right <br />
<br />
MILH. Yes, and they'll maintain it too ! <br />
<br />
LAF. Ah ! hear you that, your Excellence ? Thought ye <br />
These men were bought by dirty Spanish gold ? <br />
You've called them traitors you are the traitor I <br />
Do you not hold a correspondence close <br />
With the governor of Havana, say ? <br />
And sent you not unto the court of Spain <br />
The names of those who led the noble band <br />
Which drove proud Don Ulloa from our shore ? <br />
I tell you, Aubry, you are the traitor. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
436 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
AUB. Gentlemen, do you suffer this ? <br />
<br />
LAF. Suffer ! <br />
<br />
Do you appeal to them ? Go, call your friends, <br />
The treacherous Spaniards. <br />
<br />
AUB. I'll call my guard. <br />
<br />
I'll have you all arrested. (The members rise and draw.) <br />
<br />
LAF. What! guard! arrest! <br />
<br />
I do defy you to attempt it. Ha ! <br />
Pronounce one word, and round us I will bring <br />
The assembled city, all up in arms, <br />
To tear thy worthless soldiery to pieces, <br />
And destroy thee with them. <br />
<br />
AUB. (softening). Excuse me, sirs, <br />
<br />
But 'twas my duty which commanded me. <br />
I meant no insult, nor was I in earnest <br />
<br />
LAF. (to Aubry}. Silence ! <br />
<br />
(To the members?) Gentlemen ! The people send me to you. <br />
My message is, that they have made me chief, <br />
And all authority have placed in me, <br />
Until invaders shall no more pollute <br />
The air we breathe. This council is dissolved ; <br />
And you, my friends, it is expected, will <br />
Unite your strength with ours, to repel <br />
The horde of bandits who, advancing fast, <br />
Approach with angry cries our walls. <br />
<br />
YIL. Whate'er <br />
<br />
Our fellow-citizens ordain, we'll do. <br />
<br />
DENOY. And we are happy, Lafreniere, that you <br />
Have been selected to command. <br />
<br />
MILH. Success <br />
<br />
Is thus insured. <br />
<br />
MAKQ. And confidence inspired. <br />
<br />
AUB. I do protest against this whole proceeding. <br />
It is illegal. <br />
<br />
LAF. (to Aubry}. Silence, I tell thee, thou perfidious <br />
Coward. <br />
<br />
(To the members.} My friends, it is my ardent wish <br />
That your great trust in me should be maintained. <br />
All my best energies I'll use to gain <br />
The franchise we aspire to. The aid <br />
Of your advice, good gentlemen, will be <br />
Of great assistance to me, and I hope <br />
That 'twill be given with profusion. Come, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 437 <br />
<br />
Let us haste ; our forces must be formed. <br />
And we must march to-night. <br />
<br />
[Exeunt LAFRENIERE, VILLERE, cmd members. <br />
AUB. A coward ! yes, <br />
<br />
I know I am a coward ; but, rash youth, <br />
With all thy bravery, I'll overcome thee. <br />
Ay ! trust thee to honor, strength, and courage. <br />
Cunning will overset thee with a straw. <br />
Aubry will teach thee lessons so severe <br />
They'll make you feel as a well-punished child <br />
Scorching 'neath his tutor's whip. I'll teach him, <br />
Young, presuming dog ! to know his fellow-men <br />
Their falsehood, and the little trust to place <br />
In all their oaths and protestations loud. <br />
To-morrow's dawn shall ope to disappoint <br />
His proud ambition and his brilliant plans. <br />

SCENE 2. Adelaide's apartment. <br />
[Enter GAKIDEL.] <br />
<br />
GAR. 'Tis now my glowing Indian blood doth flow <br />
"With all its vigor through my beating veins. <br />
How high it leaps at thoughts of gratified <br />
Eevenge ! (Holds up the vial of poison.} All hail, thou elixir of <br />
<br />
hell! <br />
<br />
Poison to her, and balm to me for every wound <br />
Inflicted by her father. Now's the time <br />
No one observes me none will dare suspect. <br />
<br />
(Takes up a vial from the toilet table.} <br />
This is her favorite essence ; 'tis the <br />
Sweet cologne of wide reputed virtue <br />
Its purity unsullied as descending dew, <br />
Its odor fragrant as a garden's breath, <br />
Its healing power most miraculous. <br />
<br />
(Pours the vial of poison into it.} <br />
Neither its odor nor its color change. <br />
Thou God ! it will succeed ! Ha ! how she'll look ! <br />
Her beauty gone and horror in its place ! <br />
I see her raving at its loss ; and he, <br />
Distracted by the dreadful blow, shall writhe <br />
Beneath the vengeful stroke. Her father, too ! <br />
Ha ! how he will feel it, when this godd( <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
438 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
This queen of beauty he so dotes upon, <br />
<br />
Will fall upon his neck all withered o'er <br />
<br />
By sullying disease ! Ha ! and perhaps <br />
<br />
He'll shrink away, and dread to kiss that cheek <br />
<br />
On which so often he has pressed the lip <br />
<br />
The fervent lip, of warm parental love. <br />
<br />
Ah ! and her mother what will she do ? Oh, <br />
<br />
She will die ! For 'tis beyond conception <br />
<br />
That she should bear the dreadful agony <br />
<br />
That this will bring upon her. They come <br />
<br />
I must not here be seen. O happy hour ! <br />
<br />
Brim full of secret pleasure. \_Exit GAKIDEL. <br />
<br />
{Enter ADELAIDE and MRS. YILLERE.] <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. My Adelaide, <br />
<br />
Thy choice, indeed, doth satisfaction give <br />
To thy fond mother. Of all the noble <br />
Youths who crowd to catch one softened ray <br />
From those bright eyes of thine, more worthy none <br />
Than young Lafreniere is to be thy lord ; <br />
His form is cast in manly beauty's mould, <br />
His heart is virtue's richest, purest gem, <br />
His mind a palace genius lighteth up. <br />
<br />
ADE. Ah, mother, thou dost almost flatter him. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Faultless, I do not say he is. <br />
<br />
ADE. Some faults <br />
<br />
He has ; but, like clouds around the sun, <br />
They're gilded over by the shining rays <br />
Cast from the brightness of his qualities, <br />
And only serve to give a high relief <br />
To all the splendor of his virtue. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Say, <br />
<br />
Think ye not he is presumptuous ? <br />
<br />
ADE. No, no. <br />
<br />
Presumption is, I think, the distance 'tween <br />
What men themselves believe to be the worth, <br />
The virtue, talent, power, they possess, <br />
And what their real value is. Pray, then, <br />
To what has young Lafreniere yet pretended <br />
In which he overprized himself ? <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Thou dost <br />
<br />
Defend him well, and with an eloquence <br />
Near equal to his own. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 439 <br />
<br />
ADE. My heart doth prompt it. <br />
<br />
(Trumpets, drums, and shouts are heard without, distantly.} <br />
<br />
MRS. VIL. Hark to these sounds ! <br />
<br />
ADE. (opening a window}. See, mother, 'tis the proud <br />
<br />
Array of war ; and, while we talk of love, <br />
Our youths abandon now their chosen fair, <br />
And court the favor of less tender dames : <br />
Glory and carnage, and bright liberty, <br />
Are now the mistresses to whom they bow, <br />
And deck their forms in warlike garb to woo. <br />
Think, mother, that our verdant fields will soon <br />
In gory streams be soaked ; and that many friends <br />
We love, 'neath hostile swords may sink. Ah ! think, <br />
That my father, too, may fall amidst the fight, <br />
Pouring his life-blood on his native soil <br />
Dying all gashed and pierced and trampled o'er <br />
By charging horses and the reckless feet <br />
Of rushing thousands. (The noises cm <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Ah ! my Adelaide, <br />
<br />
Thou bringest on me thoughts which shake my soul <br />
E'en to its inmost dwelling. <br />
<br />
[Enter YILLERE.] <br />
<br />
ADE. Father ! <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Husband ! <br />
<br />
YIL. My wife my child ! <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. Yillere, <br />
<br />
I read my fate already in thine eye. <br />
Thou art called to risk thy life, so precious <br />
To our hearts, in battle's dreadful fury. <br />
And must we now, when years of quiet and <br />
Content have blessed our union, part with fear <br />
Of never meeting more ? <br />
<br />
YIL. Not so, my spouse. <br />
<br />
Let not thus fear victorious hold the sway <br />
Of thy true heart. Let rather pleasing hopes <br />
Dispel thy cloudy bodings of the future. <br />
No share to me is granted in the fight <br />
Which is to fix my country's destiny ; <br />
And, though I begged a station to obtain <br />
In its defenders' ranks, my prayer was vain. <br />
Lafreniere, whom the people have appointed <br />
Leader, sends me amongst the settlements <br />
To call in all Louisiana's force, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
440 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
And gain the succor of our red allies. <br />
<br />
From thence, in haste, I'll wend my lengthened way <br />
<br />
To ask assistance of that noble race <br />
<br />
Who dwell along Atlantic's western shore, <br />
<br />
And who are now, in proud array, opposed <br />
<br />
To proud Britannia's tyranny. <br />
<br />
MRS. VIL. Thanks to Lafreniere for this happy care. <br />
Much will I try, the pleasure now he gives <br />
This sorrowing breast, in double fold to pay. <br />
<br />
ADE. But, father, dost thou leave us e'en to-day ? <br />
<br />
YIL. Yes, all is ready, and I go e'en now ; <br />
My steed awaits me at the gate. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. My love, <br />
<br />
Why haste you thus ? Oh, wait until the morn ! <br />
Stay with us yet this day. <br />
<br />
YIL. Each minute counts. <br />
<br />
Come, then, embrace thy husband e'er he goes. (They embrace.} <br />
My country needs the promptest services, <br />
And I must fly upon the wings of haste. <br />
My daughter, go, tell Garidel prepare <br />
<br />
To start upon this voyage with me. [Exit ADELAIDE. <br />
<br />
Come, my love, be not depressed. I'll send thee news <br />
Of all that doth befall me as I go. <br />
<br />
MRS. YIL. And must it then be so ? But, Yillere, say, <br />
Wilt thou be absent long ? <br />
<br />
YIL. But six short weeks <br />
<br />
Will suffice for my duty. I'll then return ; <br />
And Heaven grant I find my country free, <br />
The Spaniards beaten, and untroubled peace <br />
Around our happy fireside ! And then, <br />
My wife, the long retarded union of <br />
Our child with Lafreniere once solemnized, <br />
In tranquil solitude we'll pass the days <br />
Of our last years. <br />

ADE. Father, thy bidding's done ; Garidel is ready. <br />

YIL. I thank thee, child ; <br />
<br />
But come before thy father goes, and take his blessing. <br />
<br />
(He kisses her forehead, and she kneels.} <br />
My daughter, Heaven bless thee, <br />

Keep thy fragile frame from pain or sickness, <br />
Preserve thee to console my coming age, <br />

THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 441 <br />

And make thee thy Lafreniere's worthy bride. (She rises.) <br />

Remember oft thy father ; in thy prayers, <br />
<br />
Each eve and morn, send up to God's high throne <br />
<br />
An earnest supplication for success <br />
<br />
To all his labor, and his safe return. <br />
<br />
ADE. Oh ! could I forget that duty, father ? <br />
Oh, may my faint petition reach the ear <br />
Of Him who holds our fate within His hand ! <br />
He'll not refuse what asks a guileless heart : <br />
He'll shield thee, father, and will keep thee for us. <br />

MRS. YIL. Nay, go not yet. <br />

YIL. Indeed, I must depart. <br />

My country calls. Adieu ! (They embrace and part.} <br />

MRS. VIL. Adieu ! [Exit VILLERE. <br />

ADE. O mother, I am faint ! This unforewarned <br />
Departure of my father striketh hard <br />
Upon my heart, and makes me feel quite sick. <br />

ADE. A little faint <br />

'Tis nothing this will drive it soon away. <br />
But, Garidel, take good care of father <br />
Let nothing do him harm. <br />

ADE. Ah! <br />
<br />
How full of pain this hour is, and how <br />
My feeble heart doth throb with suffering ! <br />

(Sees a letter on the toilet.} <br />
<br />
Ah, a letter ! 'Tis addressed to me. What can <br />
It be ? (Opens it and reads.} " Adelaide, thy love's bestowed <br />
On one unworthy ; and the hot passion <br />
He pretends, a false heart disguises. <br />
His high ambition and his secret plans <br />
Force him to seek an union which will gain <br />
A strong support to all his wild designs. <br />
And, lady, though he feels no spark of love, <br />
Yet still he woos thee for thy name, and will <br />
Perhaps e'en yet sufficient power have <br />
To make thee spurn the warning of a friend." <br />
Ah ! can this be true, or is it calumny ? <br />
O Lafreniere, couldst thou deceive me thus ? <br />
Oh, double blow of pitiless misfortune ! <br />

LAF. Nay? sa y n t so. <br />
<br />
Thou art not serious, Adelaide. Ah, <br />
That blush which doth suffuse thy lovely cheek <br />
Methinks doth tell another tale ! <br />
<br />
ADE. Blush, sir ! <br />
<br />
The red that rose upon my brow doth mark <br />
My great displeasure at the sight of thee. <br />
<br />
LAF. Heaven ! what crime have I committed ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Say, <br />
<br />
Art thou not false, and is not Ambition <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 443 <br />
<br />
The only dame whose favors thou dost court <br />
When thou dost kneel to me ? <br />
<br />
LAF. 'Tis true I am <br />
<br />
Ambitious ; but, my Adelaide, I swear <br />
Thou'rt joined with my ambition's brightest dream ; <br />
And laurels, riches, fame, I'd cast away <br />
As childish baubles, nor would I aspire <br />
To aught above the name of honest man, <br />
Did I not think to share these things with thee. <br />
<br />
ADE. Most bravely, frankly, said ; and thou too canst <br />
Thine honor and thy truth both lay aside <br />
With her whose weakness ye'd beguile. Sir, <br />
I have friends who o'er my welfare watch, <br />
And whose kind care detected have thy plans <br />
Thy wily, base, ungenerous plots. <br />
<br />
LAF. (kneeling). Upon my knees I pray thee, Adelaide, <br />
Tell me what whim is this. What black falsehood <br />
Hast thou heard which makes thee doubt, what ne'er <br />
Until to-day hath been impeached by woman or <br />
By man Lafreniere's honor ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Ay, 'tis thus <br />
<br />
With all your sex : ye kneel and cringe ; <br />
With cheating words, and oaths, and promises, <br />
And whining prayers, ye do triumph o'er <br />
Our unsuspecting hearts ; and when we own <br />
Your power, and our love to masters change ; <br />
Poor feeble woman's duty then becomes <br />
To watch each caprice of a tyrant's will <br />
Live in his smile and wither 'neath his frown. <br />
<br />
LAF. (who has risen). Lady, I've done. Thou'lt hear from me <br />
<br />
no more <br />
<br />
Words prompted by my passion's ardor. Yet <br />
Do not think the fire that burns within <br />
This breast will cease to burn. Though smothered, <br />
'Twill not die, and, thus confined, 'twill torture <br />
None but me. My countrymen await me. <br />
Oh, may I lead them unto victory, <br />
And may /meet with death ! [Exit LAFRENIEKE. <br />
<br />
ADE. What have I done ? <br />
<br />
Why did I not show him this ? Laf Ah, no ! <br />
I must not call him back ; he would exult <br />
As in a victory. Proud of the strong <br />
Seductions of his mien and eloquence, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
444 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
He'd look upon me as a conquered slave. <br />
<br />
No, no : I'm full of love, yet I'm as proud <br />
<br />
As he. Ah, my mother ! To thee I'll haste <br />
<br />
For consolation to my stricken breast. \Exit~ <br />
<br />
SCENE 3. A Wood (Night). <br />
[Enter AUBEY, accompanied by RUFFIANS.] <br />
<br />
ATJB. Yes ; this is the place fixed by Garidel <br />
His note describes it well. Go ye and hide <br />
Behind these trees ; and, when I the signal give, <br />
Hush on Sir Villere ye know him all. Mind, <br />
Shed not one drop of blood, or ye shall not <br />
Be paid a single sou. Remember well, <br />
That he that's with him is a friend. Go. [Exit rujfians- <br />
<br />
Now, <br />
<br />
Villere, I think I'll make thee much repent <br />
This morning's insult, thrown with heedless hand <br />
Into my face. Villere my prisoner, <br />
My favor with the Spanish chief is doubly <br />
Sure ; and thus both interest and my hate <br />
I serve at once ; and yet I will myself <br />
Be safe, nor stand the danger of a blow. <br />
'Tis thus with prudence men should ever act, <br />
Nor rashly jeopardize their own lives <br />
In open combats of uncertain end. <br />
It is not all to serve the spite one feels, <br />
But most maturely should we weigh results. <br />
None would I hurt who useful to me are, <br />
Though I should hate them with a poisoned hate. <br />
But if I loved a man though that can't be <br />
I'd have him murdered if he barred my plans. <br />
These fights, done in the world's wide eye, create <br />
To one an host of angry enemies ; <br />
But 'tis the midnight blow, the killing draught, <br />
Which yield revenge while safety is not risked ; <br />
And on to-morrow I can give this hand <br />
Into the brother of the man it kills <br />
To-night. <br />
<br />
GAR. (outside). 'Tis a fit place. Good Sir Villere, <br />
Let us here dismount and seek the path : on foot <br />
We'll find it easier. Our steeds are tired <br />
Let's give them rest a while. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 445 <br />
<br />
AUB. Ah, here they come, <br />
<br />
I must conceal myself ; I'll not approach <br />
<br />
Until he's well secured and bound. [Exit AUBRY. <br />
<br />
[Enter GARIDEL and YILLERE.] <br />
<br />
VIL. Well, Garidel, <br />
<br />
With thy fancy for a shorter path, <br />
We're lost, and now must pass the dreary night <br />
In this cold morass. <br />
<br />
GAR. I promise it, good sir, <br />
<br />
That in a healthy bed you'll sleep this night, <br />
And 'neath a shelter most secure. (Thunder.) <br />
<br />
YIL. Hear that ! <br />
<br />
And we shall have a storm to make the night <br />
Most comfortably romantic. (Lightning and thunder.) <br />
<br />
GAR. Indeed, <br />
<br />
Sir Yillere, walk with me but some few steps : <br />
Surely I'll meet with friends. <br />
<br />
[Enter RUFFIANS slowly creeping behind.] <br />
<br />
YIL. Pshaw ! seest thou not <br />
<br />
That we are in the very swamp itself ? <br />
This delay distracts me. Oh, my country ! <br />
May Heaven shield thee till I send thee help. <br />
I fear the battle, on which turns thy fate, <br />
Will be decided e'er I send thee succor ; <br />
And that thy little band will be o'erwhelmed. <br />
<br />
GAR. Come. This swampy air doth chill your blood : <br />
<br />
YIL. (turning, sees the RUFFIANS and draws). Ah, see, <br />
Garidel ! through the darkness I discover <br />
Some human figures lurking. <br />
<br />
GAR. Ah! doubtless <br />
<br />
They are black, runaways ! Give me your sword, <br />
For I am young and strong ; take these instead. <br />
(They exchange arms. YILLERE gives GARIDEL his sword, who <br />
returns a brace of pistols. The RUFFIANS rush on YILLERE, who <br />
attempts to fire, but the pistols snap. The RUFFIANS seize him.) <br />
<br />
YIL. Treachery ! Wretches ! slaves ! unhand me ! <br />
(The curtain falls.) <br />
<br />
ACT III. <br />
SCENE 1. The interior of LAFRENIERE'S tent. <br />
<br />
[Enter LAFRENIERE.] <br />
<br />
LAF. I like the plan ; it will, I think, secure <br />
A glorious victory. On one side <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
446 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
The deep, broad, rapid Mississippi rolls ; <br />
<br />
And, on the other, impenetrable swamps <br />
<br />
Prevent approaches of the foe. Our front <br />
<br />
Protected by a breastwork and a fosse, <br />
<br />
We can defy the well-drilled troops of Spain, <br />
<br />
Bring all our force to bear, and though unused <br />
<br />
To battle (yet, in savage forests trained <br />
<br />
To use, with fatal aim, the carabine), <br />
<br />
Americana' s brave and hardy sons <br />
<br />
Will strew the field with dead, make the Spaniard <br />
<br />
Shrink away with dread, and victory insure. <br />
<br />
Yes, I like the plan ; it answers well ; <br />
<br />
It is the only one by which the rising <br />
<br />
City of my birth, Louisiana's pride, <br />
<br />
Can be defended 'gainst invading hordes <br />
<br />
Who seek for rapine and for slaughter. <br />
<br />
{Enter AUBBY.] <br />
<br />
Aubry ! What wouldst coward, traitor, here ? <br />
Hast thou repented hast thou brave become, <br />
And wouldst thou aid thy country in the fight ? <br />
Or dost thou come, a cunning spy, to watch <br />
Our movements, and give the Spaniards notice ? <br />
<br />
AUB. Lafreniere, I am no traitor. I ne'er <br />
Acknowledged thy authority, nor that <br />
Of those who rashly made you chief : I owe <br />
Allegiance to the Spanish king ; and I <br />
Do show obedience to the plain command <br />
Of Louis, by whose decree and gracious will <br />
I held the rule o'er this fair colony. <br />
I have protested, but in vain 'twas done, <br />
'Gainst thine and the people's usurpation <br />
Of the power which belonged to me. But since <br />
My proclamation is disdained, <br />
I ask thee chief of this rebel army <br />
<br />
LAF. (offers to strike him}. Eebel ! vile traitor, had I not pity <br />
On thy helplessness, I'd shake thy limbs apart <br />
For this insulting insolence. <br />
<br />
AUB. Nay, sir, <br />
<br />
Excuse my words ; no insult did I mean, <br />
And hope it is not taken so. The words <br />
Came of themselves upon my lip : I called <br />
Them not with wish of giving you offence ; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1768. 447 <br />
<br />
But rebels, fear I, ye will still be named, <br />
Unless victorious in the coming fight <br />
<br />
(LAFRENIERE offers to draw.) <br />
Nay, sir I beg I would not anger you <br />
There's no insult meant. <br />
<br />
LAF. Speak ! What wouldst thou ? <br />
<br />
AUB. I pray that, since I owe you no submission, <br />
Since enrolment with you is but voluntary, <br />
Since 'tis the duty of the rank I hold, <br />
Since my proclamation has been vain, <br />
That you would let me, at this hour, repair <br />
Unto the Spanish camp, and there remain, <br />
And all the rights of war partake as do <br />
The other subjects of the Iberian king. <br />
<br />
LAF. Pshaw ! Think' st thou that we do want thee 'mongst us ? <br />
Go, sir ! The service thou canst render Spain <br />
Will do us little injury. Go, sir ! <br />
And bow thy servile head unto the slave <br />
Of Europe's vilest despot. Go, sir ! <br />
We want not cowards, traitors, 'mongst us ; <br />
We'll dread thee less when in the Spanish camp. <br />
<br />
AUB. I thank you, sir I go ; but <br />
<br />
LAF. Mind thee, sir, <br />
<br />
Thou'lt run much risk to cross this camp ; for if <br />
One of the citizens discover thee, <br />
Thou'lt soon be torn into a thousand parts. <br />
<br />
AUB. I know that ; for I heard them cursing me, <br />
As I passed through them to you. I dread not <br />
Such detection ; this cloak doth hide me well. <br />
But can I pass the outposts ? <br />
<br />
LAF. Thou couldst not, <br />
<br />
Unless thou hadst the word. But that would make <br />
Thee tremble, but to hear it spoken out; <br />
'T would choke thy utterance to speak the word ; <br />
'Twas made for braves and freemen to pronounce. <br />
Without there ! citizen ! <br />
<br />
\Enter SOLDIER.] <br />
Conduct this <br />
Man beyond the outposts, and leave him free. <br />
<br />
[Exit SOLDIER and AUBRY, who bows to LAFRENIERE as he goes out. <br />
O man ! thou art a creature strange indeed ! <br />
Who can explain the workings of thy heart ? <br />
