<br />
DREAM OF LAFKENIERE. <br />
<br />
(BETWEEN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH ACTS.) <br />
LAFRENIERE appears sleeping in a prison. <br />
<br />
The prison vanishes, and a landscape appears ; a wide river flow^s <br />
through the centre ; and on each side of it, extensive forests and <br />
uncultivated fields are seen. On one side stands a throne, on which <br />
a personification of Europe is seated, holding a sceptre, and having a <br />
lash and fetters lying at her feet. A personification of Louisiana sits <br />
weeping, chained to the throne ; plaintive music, and pantomime <br />
expressive of the distress of Louisiana, and of the despotism and <br />
cruelty of Europe. <br />
<br />
The music gradually changes to more stern and threatening tones ; <br />
the sky darkens ; clouds appear ; the thunder is heard, and the light- <br />
ning flashes. <br />
<br />
A thunderbolt strikes the throne, which crumbles to pieces, while <br />
Europe is thrown prostrate on the earth. <br />
<br />
The gloom is dispelled, the clouds disappear, the music is joyful, <br />
and Louisiana exults. <br />
<br />
Liberty appears descending from above, bearing the American flag. <br />
Above the head of Liberty seventeen stars [representing the number <br />
of States of the Union at the time Louisiana was admitted] appear <br />
arranged in a circle around the words " CONSTITUTION," " UNION." <br />
<br />
Liberty approaches and takes off the fetters of Louisiana, saying : <br />
" Arise, my child, rejoin thy sisters. Thou art free." They embrace <br />
each other, while Liberty points to the Star of Louisiana rising in the <br />
sky, and ranging itself with the others. <br />
<br />
" Hail, Columbia," breaks forth, and to that tune the fields flourish, <br />
cities rise, boats and ships ply upon the river, and busy crowds of <br />
people thicken on the landscape. <br />
<br />
The prison resumes awhile its appearance, and again disappears <br />
to give place to a dark curtain, on which suddenly appears a circle of <br />
portraits (drawn in white) representing the Kevolutionary heroes and <br />
worthies, with Washington in the centre. <br />

THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 463 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ACT V. <br />
<br />
SCENE 1. A Prison. LAFRENIERE fettered, and chained to a ring <br />
<br />
the wall. <br />
<br />
LAF. O Liberty, thou art not invincible ! <br />
Slaves by plunder baited have o'erthrown thee, <br />
And thus it seems, that hearts inclined to crime <br />
Do feel for crime as great enthusiasm, <br />
As souls which take their fire from the skies <br />
Do in the acting of a virtuous deed. <br />
<br />
my country ! and art thou then like me <br />
Chained, fettered, and beneath a tyrant's foot ? <br />
Ah ! was green America sought in vain <br />
<br />
By Pilgrim Fathers, flying 'cross the main <br />
<br />
To seek a refuge from oppression's rod ? <br />
<br />
Were its wide forests, where untutored men <br />
<br />
Live 'neath the shade of the tall magnolia <br />
<br />
Were its broad rivers, 'gainst whose current nought <br />
<br />
But the Indian's light canoe can ply <br />
<br />
Was its free soil, from whence civilization's foot <br />
<br />
Not yet treads down and wears the verdure off <br />
<br />
Were these unto degrading slavery doomed ? <br />
<br />
Oh, no ; it cannot be ! And still I hope. <br />
<br />
Last night, when dragged across the horrid field,. <br />
<br />
Where hundreds of my countrymen laid dead, <br />
<br />
Pierced by mercenary swords and balls, <br />
<br />
1 was thrown here, within this dungeon dark <br />
Long did I weep Louisiana's fall, <br />
<br />
Till sorrow's fount was drained all dry : <br />
<br />
Sleep came at last, and closed my heavy eyes <br />
<br />
To ope imagination's lids on worlds <br />
<br />
Unknown, and in prophetic dreams to wake <br />
<br />
Midst future days. I saw, though Death metheught <br />
<br />
Did press me down with his unbending arm, <br />
<br />
My country in a veil of darkness wrapped, <br />
<br />
Her wrists and ankles worn by clinching chains, <br />
<br />
Her back all marked with deep and bleeding stripes, <br />
<br />
And moaning 'midst her sufferings. But soon <br />
<br />
The darkness vanished, and a brilliant light <br />
<br />
Dispersed the clouds which hung around in gloom ; <br />
<br />
And forth appeared, in shining radiance, <br />
<br />
A youth whose air spoke Freedom, and whose frame <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
464 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
Was built with strength and grace ; in his right hand <br />
<br />
A palm and sword he held, and in his left <br />
<br />
A scroll on which eternal truths were written, <br />
<br />
And a floating banner, where, in beauty <br />
<br />
Elended, were the white, and blue, and red, <br />
<br />
In fulgent stars and flowing stripes disposed. <br />
<br />
He broke her bonds, and with his manly voice <br />
<br />
Exclaimed, " Go, join thy sisters ; thou art free." <br />
<br />
[Enter ADELAIDE.] <br />
<br />
Adelaide ! What miracle has oped the door <br />
Of this gloomy dungeon to let thee in ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Lafreniere, I bring thee news of freedom ! <br />
With gold what Spaniard can resist its lure ? <br />
I've gained thy jailer, and to-night thou flyest. <br />
<br />
LAF. Fly ! Lady, no ! Here will I stay, and meet <br />
My fate, whate'er it be. <br />
<br />
ADE. And that is death, <br />
<br />
If thou dost here remain. <br />
<br />
LAF. A brave man's death <br />
<br />
Is better than a coward's flight. <br />
<br />
ADE. 'Tis true. <br />
<br />
Couldst thou defend thyself, I'd rather see <br />
Thee fighting sword in hand, than aid thy flight ; <br />
But here assassination doth await thee, <br />
And, while thou sleepest, treachery will plunge <br />
His poisoned knife into thy noble heart. <br />
<br />
LAF. I care not how these Spaniards end my life ; <br />
My destiny is fixed. In freedom's cause <br />
To die, is greater, in my estimation, <br />
Than dragging out in vile obscurity <br />
An useless life. To-day it is the richest prize <br />
My country's conquerors have gained. <br />
"Well, let them have it, while 'tis worth a crime. <br />
Thy father, girl, is laid among the martyrs <br />
Who yesterday did shed their blood and die <br />
For liberty. What ! Shall / shrink away <br />
And dread the example he has set me ? <br />
<br />
ADE. Then there was hope, but now <br />
<br />
LAF. Honor and glory <br />
<br />
Yet remain to be completely gained. <br />
<br />
ADE. Nay, <br />
<br />
Lafreniere, if thou lovest me, leave these vain <br />
Aspirings. Listen. There is an aged <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MARTYR PATRIOTS; OR, LOUISIANA IN 1769. 465 <br />
<br />
African, who seeing, as I passed by, <br />
<br />
The threatened dissolution of my features, <br />
<br />
Offered to give me certain antidotes <br />
<br />
For the evil which afflicts me now. <br />
<br />
Lafreniere, thou art now the only prop <br />
<br />
Round which my life's weak vine will twine itself : <br />
<br />
My father mother both have been snapped off, <br />
<br />
And if thou fallest, Adelaide falls too. <br />
<br />
LAF. God, give me strength to meet this trial hard ! <br />
<br />
ADE. I will fly with thee to some distant land ; <br />
And there, in wedded love, we'll live in peace, <br />
Blest by contentment and a quiet home. <br />
<br />
LAF. "Tis wrong to put into my hands thy fate ; <br />
Why with dilemma thus surround me ? <br />
On one side, honor, the fame I cherish, <br />
Call me to stay and die ; on the other, <br />
My love, thy happiness and threatened life, <br />
Unite to make me swerve from duty's path. <br />
Adelaide, thou art unjust ; assist me <br />
Eather to preserve my fame unspotted, <br />
And tempt me not to play a shameful part. <br />
<br />
ADE. 'Tis said the northern colonies have raised, <br />
And threaten rebellion against England. <br />
Go, join them, and for freedom fight with them. <br />
<br />
LAF. I've sworn to free my country or to die ! <br />
<br />
ADE. Dost thou refuse ? <br />
<br />
LAF. I do. <br />
<br />
(She sinks down upon a seat.} <br />
Nay, Adelaide, <br />
Sustain thyself with better courage. <br />
<br />
[Enter AUBKY.] <br />
<br />
Aubry here ! <br />
<br />
AUB. Ha ! ha ! "Well, my good sir, what say you now ? <br />
Ha ! You have struck heaped insults on me <br />
Called me a coward. "Well, you spoke the truth. <br />
Say, what think ye of a coward's vengeance ? <br />
<br />
(LAFKENIEKE rushes at him, but is stopped ~by the chain.) <br />
No, no ! I had these chains too well prepared. <br />
<br />
ADE. Monster ! <br />
<br />
AUB. Ha ! Foolish wench ! "What dost thou here ? <br />
<br />
"Well, 'tis a double blow I'll strike. Listen. <br />
Ye know not all I've done against you both. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
466 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
'Twas I seduced that rascal Garidel <br />
<br />
To place bis master in the Spaniard's hand, <br />
<br />
To pour a poison over this maiden's beauty, <br />
<br />
(LAFRENIERE strains to break his chains, and sinks down in the effort, <br />
trembling with rage.) <br />
<br />
Keep cool, good sir, that is not half. 'Twas I <br />
<br />
Who made him plunge a dagger in the heart <br />
<br />
Of Villere. <br />
<br />
ADE. God! God! (Faints.) <br />
<br />
AUB. What ! Faint already ? <br />
<br />
Halloo without there ! <br />
<br />
\Enter JAILER.] <br />
<br />
Here, jailer, take out <br />
This foolish girl, and throw her in the ditch. <br />
<br />
[Exit JAILEE bearing out ADELAIDE. <br />
<br />
So, sir, you have freed your country, have you ? <br />
<br />
A great and mighty general indeed ! <br />
<br />
Poor foolish vain rash green hot-headed boy! <br />
<br />
What ! Did you think to thwart a man like me '( <br />
<br />
Thy wild ambition showed the crazy youth, <br />
<br />
And not a man to lead an army on. <br />
<br />
Why were not the outskirts of your army <br />
<br />
Better guarded ? I led the Spaniards round <br />
<br />
And came upon your rear, nor even met <br />
<br />
A single scout until our drums ye heard. <br />
<br />
Ay, sir ! To me you owe your fall. Say, <br />
<br />
What think you of the puny coward now ? <br />
<br />
LAF. (rising). Aubry, I do despise thee still, and still <br />
I do defy thee ! Do thy worst ! All's not done <br />
/ still exist. Why am I not murdered ? <br />
Ye cannot lack for those who'd do the deed ; <br />
The country's full of Spaniards now. <br />
<br />
AUB. Be sure <br />
<br />
I will not leave my work unfinished thus, <br />
Nor can you teach me how to do it, boy. <br />
Ye shall not be murdered in the dark. No ! <br />
I'll have you ended on the public square. <br />
I'll have you tried, condemned in form, and shot ! <br />
You shall have company ; four of your friends, <br />
Denoyant, Carrere, Milhet, and Marquis, <br />
Have been already sentenced. <br />

LAF. Wretch ! <br />
<br />
AUB. They come. <br />
<br />
Your judges here advance ; and, what is more, <br />
I am their colleague named. <br />

LAF. Thou ! <br />

together with AUBKY.] <br />
<br />
FIRST JUDGE. Is this the man ? <br />
<br />
AUB. It is. <br />
<br />
FIRST JUDGE. Of heinous crimes, <br />
<br />
Against your rightful king, you are accused. <br />
You have upraised sedition in this province ; <br />
You have been the chief of discontented bands ; <br />
You have led them on against the army <br />
Sent by his Majesty Most Catholic, <br />
Our gracious lord and master, Charles the Third, <br />
By grace of God King of Spain and India, <br />
To take possession of his proper claim, <br />
And legal acquisition in one word, <br />
High treason is your crime. <br />
<br />
LAF. Most wise judges, <br />
<br />
Do I well hear your words ? Is it to judge <br />
Ye come, or, most sage and sapient judges, <br />
Am I condemned already ? Mark your words : <br />
" You have upraised sedition in this land, <br />
You have been the chief of discontented bands, <br />
You have "- " You have," good sirs, be not so swift ;. <br />
Convict me first, and then my sentence read. <br />
<br />
AUB. Colleague, proceed in better form. Ask first <br />
His name. <br />
<br />
LAF. You're right, let it be done in form, <br />
Let me be murdered legally. <br />
<br />
FIRST JUDGE. Mind, sir, <br />
<br />
"With more respect your judges treat. Speak, <br />
But no insulting language use. Say, <br />
What is your name ? <br />
<br />
LAF. Great Judge ! That very name <br />
<br />
Is the greatest insult I can speak <br />
When I address ye ; and by to-morrow <br />
'Twill be a greater insult still. It is <br />
For I am proud to speak it Lafreniere ! <br />

LAF. Most pleased am I to answer. <br />

I am a Creole, born in ISTew Orleans. <br />

FIRST JUDGE. Your profession ? <br />
<br />
LAF. An advocate. <br />
<br />
FIRST JUDGE. Your age ? <br />

LAF. Out, dastards ! I'll parley no more with ye. <br />
Ye know me who I am, and what I am ; <br />
And I plead guilty in every point <br />
On which ye do accuse me ay, guilty ! <br />
And glory in what ye call a crime. Go ! <br />
I hate your nation and your tyrant King, <br />

In due form, of high treason 'gainst the King, <br />

LAF. Thank ye, kind gentlemen, ye could not more <br />
Give pleasure to me ; know, I kiss your hands, <br />

To-day my name is written in the sacred book <br />
The purest, chosen page of history. <br />
From now my cherished name will live <br />

SCENE 2. The Public Square. <br />
[Enter a RUFFIAN.] <br />
<br />
EUF. The citizens have fled as if a pestilence <br />
Infected all this section of the city ; <br />
The place is desolate e'en as 'twere night. <br />
'Tis here they'll shoot the Creole chief to-day. <br />
A fine time this to rob some straying fool : <br />
If some rich scoundrel now would only pass <br />
Across this green, how quick I'd murder him, <br />
And rob him of his gold ! Ah, some one comes ! <br />
By the Holy Virgin, it is Aubry, <br />
For whom we seized the old man in the forest ! <br />
He's loaded, doubtless, with the riches gained <br />
By turning traitor to his countrymen. <br />
I'm tempted strong to let him pass along, <br />
For he is one of us who kill and steal <br />
And take false oath. Ha ! he lets fall a purse. <br />
Pshaw ! he picks it up. Saints ! 'tis full of gold ! <br />
By the holy cross, I'll have it ! (Retires^ <br />

AUB. 'Tis well! <br />
<br />
My work is done. I am revenged, and now, <br />
With all the riches I have gained, I'll go <br />
To Europe and enjoy myself. But <br />
I must behold Lafreniere e'er I go. <br />
To-day he takes his crown of glory, and <br />
'Tis my purpose here to calculate, with care, <br />
The different value of his gain from mine. (Holding up the purse.} <br />
Money ! who'd not worship thee is but a fool. <br />
What is fame, honors, titles, place, to thee ? <br />

And yield to my desires, than will e'er recall <br />

The memory of this great Lafreniere. <br />

Learn to make money, and then ye may <br />
<br />
Dispense with further knowledge. Gain riches ; <br />
<br />
It decks the bearer more than wisdom would, <br />
<br />
It is the power of a mighty prince, <br />
<br />
It is a brilliant title to one's name. <br />
<br />
See ! It has no smell nor pleasing taste, <br />
<br />
"Tis rigid to the touch, and yonder flower <br />
<br />
Which blooms unnoticed in the grass <br />
<br />
Exceeds it far in beauty ; yet I <br />
<br />
Have been as false and cruel as the tiger <br />
<br />

Was quickly, cheaply gained. <br />

Which glittered round a Eoman conqueror. <br />
I envy not the wreath that CaBsar wore <br />
When, from Pharsalia's field, he trod on Eome. <br />
His coronet was steeped in freemen's blood, <br />
Mine shall be wet with their regretful tears ; <br />
He sought to fetter Rome in slavery, <br />
I tried to make my native country free ; <br />
He died with usurpation's hand outstretched, <br />
I fall the martyr of bright liberty. <br />
And could I envy Ca3sar now ? Oh, no ! <br />
Like him I failed to gain a prize most dear, <br />
Yet do I die more proudly than he died ; <br />
For this I leave behind a virtuous name. <br />

Will rise into a monument of fame, <br />
Will nourish seeds of freedom in this soil, <br />
And bless our country with five patriot names. <br />
Denoyant, say ! since Freedom's cause is lost, <br />
Couldst thou wish aught more glorious than this, <br />
The death of freemen for their country slain ? <br />
<br />
DEN. Ay, and who still defy the tyrant's power ; <br />
For though he slay us, and revengefully <br />
Should drag our bodies in ignoble dust, <br />
Yet, here or hence, our souls are ever free, <br />
And spurn the mandates of his tyranny. <br />
<br />
MARQ. Unto us now the value of this life <br />
Is wholly lost ; a foreign master treads <br />
Upon our native land. <br />
<br />
MIL. How could we live <br />
<br />
Beneath the rule of such inhuman slaves ? <br />
Their hands are red with Villere's honored blood. <br />
<br />
CAR. To me now death has all of freedom's charms ; <br />
For death will burst oppressive chains. <br />
<br />
LAF. 'Tis well ! <br />
<br />
Dear friends, now let us yield our ready breasts <br />
Unto the bullets of these murderers, <br />
Who bring disgrace upon the soldier's garb. <br />
<br />
(To the FIRST SPANISH SOLDIER.) Come ! why lag you thus your <br />
duty to perform ? <br />
<br />
(The SOLDIER offers to bandage his eyes.) <br />
Not so ! Think ye we cannot look on death ? <br />
Thou hast already seen us look it in the face. <br />
Where shall Ave stand ? <br />
<br />
FIRST SPANISH SOLDIER. Yonder, between the trees. <br />
<br />
LAF. And now, my native land, but one more glance, <br />
And then I'll close my eyes in death with joy. <br />
Adieu, blue sky and verdant foliage, <br />
'JSeath which, when but a child, I loved to play <br />
With bounding limbs and fluttering heart, <br />
Adieu ! I look no more with pleasure on ye <br />
Ye are no more what I did love ye for. <br />
<br />
( While LAFRENIERE is speaking, his companions retire behind the scenes <br />
on the left. Exit LAFRENIERE, same side.} <br />
<br />
LAF. (without). Now now ! with hand in hand we'll fall at <br />
<br />
once <br />
For right and liberty ! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
472 POETR Y DRAMA TIC. <br />
<br />
FIRST SPANISH SOLDIER. Are you prepared ? <br />
<br />
LAF. (outside}. We are ! <br />
<br />
FIRST SPANISH SOLDIER. Soldiers, attention ! Ready ! Aim ! <br />
<br />
LAF. (outside). Liberty forever ! <br />
<br />
FIRST SPANISH SOLDIER. Fire ! <br />
<br />
(As the soldiers fire, ADELAIDE rushes in between them and LAFRE- <br />
NIERE, and falls wounded. LAFRENIERE staggers in, mortally wounded, <br />
in several parts of the body, cmd falters towards her.) <br />
<br />
LAF. God ! she is killed. <br />
<br />
Adelaide ! Adelaide ! <br />
<br />
ADE. I thank that ball <br />
<br />
By my torn side it lets in death ah love <br />
Dost thou still live ? Lafreniere, I've news news ! <br />
<br />
(LAFRENIERE sinks down.) <br />
Nav, live awhile to hear me e'er you die <br />
Aubry, Aubry is dead murdered murdered <br />
By a Spaniard for his gold the gold he got <br />
From Spaniards to betray us Adieu ! (She dies.) <br />
LAF. Great God ! (Rises.) <br />
FIRST SPANISH SOLDIER. Load, load your guns again, and finish <br />
<br />
him ! <br />
<br />
LAF. 'Tis useless I feel the cold hand of death <br />
Press from my heart its last last drop of blood. <br />
Louisianians, by my example learn <br />
How great how noble is a freeman's death ! (Falls and dies.) <br />

PAEKHASIUS; OK, THKIFTLESS AMBITION.* <br />
A Dramatic Poem. <br />
<br />
BY ESPY W. H. WILLIAMS. <br />
<br />
[ESPY WILLIAM HENDRICKS WILLIAMS was born, January 30, 1852, in Carrollton <br />
(now Seventh District of New Orleans), La. He was educated at his home until he <br />
attained his thirteenth year, when he was placed in a public school. He was conversant <br />
with the works of the best English dramatists before he was seventeen. Since 1869 he <br />
has been actively engaged in the insurance business in his native city. He has contrib- <br />
uted verses to the leading magazines of the country. In 1873 he wrote Prince Carlos, <br />
a blank verse tragedy, which was subsequently performed by the "New Histrionics," a <br />
dramatic club of New Orleans. In his book, A Dream of Art, and Other Poems (1892), <br />
is included his dramatic poem entitled The Atheist. Among his unpublished dramas <br />
are, Prince Carlos, Eugene Aram, The La#t Witch, and Dante.'] <br />

DEDICATION TO NANNIE. <br />
<br />
Dear heart, whose life must ever be <br />
<br />
The music, of my life, <br />
Whose soul awakes the harmony <br />
<br />
Still wins my soul from strife <br />
To thee,for whom my all is wrought, <br />
I give my latest gift of thought. <br />

THE STUDIO OF PARRHASIUS. <br />
<br />
(PAEKHASIUS at work upon his painting of "Prometheus Bound" <br />
THEON seated near.} <br />
<br />
THEON. <br />
<br />
Ambition ? Fame ? Beware, beware, Parrhasius ! <br />
Who tempts the envy of the gods courts ruin. <br />
Such fame as men award their honored kind, <br />
The fame of good deeds, charity, and love, <br />
<br />
* [On this dramatic poem the author founded his tragedy of Parrhasius, the stage <br />
right of which is the property of the well-known actor, Mr. Robert Mantell, who has made <br />
it 'a prominent addition to his repertory. The poem is included in this volume with the <br />
consent of both the author and Mr. Mantell.] <br />

474 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
Brightens Olympus with a smile, and, yes ! <br />
<br />
Makes us in nature gods, though not in name. <br />
<br />
But such as thou wouldst strive for, such as lives <br />
<br />
Alone the symbol of imperious self, <br />
<br />
That shun ! It is the gods' prerogative. <br />
<br />
They have themselves forewarned us from it ! Think <br />
<br />
Of Phaeton ; yes ! and Prometheus, <br />
<br />
Whose expiating tortures thou wouldst paint. <br />
<br />
PAKKHASIUS. <br />
<br />
A Socrates ! a very Socrates ! <br />
We now have two in Athens. <br />
<br />
THEON. <br />
<br />
Scoff not so. <br />
<br />
I am not worthy to be liked to him <br />
Whose greatness hath appalled our worthiest great. <br />
^Not so, Parrhasius. <br />
<br />
PABRHASIUS. <br />
Well, he is the greater. <br />
<br />
THEON. <br />
<br />
Ay, greatest ! See in him thy best example. <br />
He sought not greatness, !&gt;ut being greatly good, <br />
The gods, the world, have thrust it nobly on him. <br />
Oh, such a man is he, indeed, Parrhasius, <br />
'Tis shameful, being men, we are unlike him ! <br />
<br />
PARRHASIUS. <br />
<br />
Words, Theon ! naught but idle, misspent words. <br />
<br />
Young as I am, I am too old to learn. <br />
<br />
I love not those poor, vain, self-immolators <br />
<br />
Philosophers whose barren lives distil <br />
<br />
But envious gall to blight the lives of others. <br />
<br />
Saving thee, Theon thee I truly honor. <br />
<br />
Thy friendship is most welcome ; give it still ; <br />
<br />
For, to be friend of such a man as thou <br />
<br />
Is of itself a praise too dear to squander. <br />
<br />
THEON. <br />
A seeker still, a hoarder still of praise. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PARRHASIUS; OR, THRIFTLESS AMBITION. 475 <br />
<br />
PARRHASIUS. <br />
<br />
But for thy lessons, give me less of them, <br />
And I will give thee greater love. <br />
<br />
THEON (aside). <br />
<br />
Self-love ! <br />
<br />
PARRHASIUS. <br />
<br />
Even as thou didst speak, to freeze me from it, <br />
<br />
I felt my blood grow warm, my soul grow great, <br />
<br />
O'erteeming with my purpose ! Even now <br />
<br />
I feel the inspiration growing on me ; <br />
<br />
Coursing my veins, and filling all my being <br />
<br />
With strong, invigorating, strange delight. <br />
<br />
Dost think that now I could forego my purpose ? <br />
<br />
Destroy my parchment ? free my prisoner ? <br />
<br />
And, by the gods, I do believe they sent him ! <br />
<br />
Never was so Prometheus-like a face <br />
<br />
And form ! Dost dream that now, and at a bidding, <br />
<br />
I could forswear a life-long cherished hope ? <br />
<br />
No ! Wouldst thou do it were the part thine own ? <br />
<br />
Thou lov'st Philosophy 'tis thy life's life ! <br />
<br />
Canst thou forswear it ? ridicule it^? scorn it ? <br />
<br />
In one quick moment root from out thy heart <br />
<br />
The garnered harvesting of all thy past ? <br />
<br />
Thou wouldst ask this of me ! Do thou the same, <br />
<br />
And I with thee join hands and die forgotten. <br />
<br />
You pause ? Reluctance clouds your face ? Why, then, <br />
<br />
Prometheus and I shall live forever ! <br />
<br />
Stay, and behold me work. <br />
<br />
THEON (rising). <br />
<br />
And do a murder. <br />
<br />
PARRHASIUS (laughing). <br />
<br />
Why, what is one man's life to that dear fame <br />
<br />
Which shall outlive the lives of centuries ? <br />
<br />
If thou wilt stay, 'tis well ; if not, farewell. <br />
<br />
And yet, methinks, the sight were worth the staying ; <br />
<br />
Time might grow gray nor gaze on such another. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
476 POETRY DRAMATIC. <br />
<br />
THEON. <br />
<br />
Alas ! your laughter yet may be a wail, <br />
Your impious fame prove misery. <br />
<br />
PARKHASIUS (calling). <br />
<br />
Ho, Damon ! <br />
THEON. <br />
<br />
I will not stay to hear or witness more ; <br />
<br />
But this remember : When the time shall come <br />
<br />
That thy own life shall prove thy greatest curse, <br />
<br />
And this one deed its climax, then recall <br />
<br />
That once thine own hand clasped the cup of peace ; <br />
<br />
And when thy friend urged thee to drink, with scorn <br />
<br />
And laughter thou didst dash it from thee. <br />
<br />
DAMON (entering). <br />
<br />
Master ? <br />
<br />
THEON (going). <br />
Farewell, Parrhasius. <br />
<br />
PARRHASIUS. <br />
<br />
Friend, fare thee well. <br />
<br />
(He conducts THEON to the door. THEON goes. Then returning, address- <br />
ing DAMON.) <br />
<br />
Slave, <br />
<br />
The captive whom I purchased, is he fed ? <br />
Strengthened with wine ? <br />
<br />
DAMON. <br />
<br />
He has been feasted, master. <br />
PAKRHASIUS. <br />
<br />
Feasted is well ; I would not have him weak. <br />
<br />
For half the misery of pain is lost <br />
<br />
Upon your wasted frames. Prometheus <br />
<br />
Was strong, and hence his agony was great. <br />
<br />
Damon, the captive, spite his grizzled head, <br />
<br />
Is strong \ At least, the wine should make him strong. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PARRHASIUS; OR, THRIFTLESS AMBITION. 477 <br />
<br />
DAMON. <br />
<br />
He is strong, master, strong without the wine ; <br />
But having wine his strength seems in his tongue. <br />
<br />
PARRHASIUS. <br />
Tongue ? tongue ? Talks he ? <br />
<br />
DAMON. <br />
<br />
Incessantly, and loud ; <br />
Bewails his fate, and curses us and thee. <br />
Tells how he is himself a freeman born ; <br />
At first betrayed by friends, at last by foes, <!-- google_ad_section_start(weight=ignore) --><br><b><div align="right"><a
