                      What ! sold like cattle ? treated with disdain \ <br>
                      No ! Louisiana's sons can never bear <br>

                      To be the first among the free to lead <br>

                      In brilliant hues of glittering hope, <br>

                      <br>
                      Comes not. I must tell him all my plans, <br>
                      And gain his sanction to them, or I fear <br>
                      They'll not succeed. In such respect are held <br>
                      His silvered head and sage advice, that once <br>
                      Unto me his adherence gained, most sure <br>
                      The people's warm approval I'll obtain, . <br>
                      And all that hope doth promise soon possess. <br>
                      Ah ! but here comes my Adelaide. O love ! <br>
                      Thou hast a power which we cannot break ! <br>
                      But though thy chains are strong, and bind us
                      tight, <br>
                      Yet they brace us up, and give us double strength
                      <br>
                      For action ; and the bold hero oft achieves <br>
                      His noblest deed when ere the doubtful fight <br>
                      He kneels to thee. <br>

                      Of humid night, are sparkling in the rose, <br>

                      When, like the early lark, I fain would seek, <br>
                      Impatient to behold, thy sunny eyes, and bask <br>

                      Is Wisdom's chosen bird. Thou shouldst be wise, <br>
                      And copy her. <br>
                      <br>

                      Make but a plaything of a woman's heart. <br>
                      Tell me, what news from France ? Since early dawn
                      <br>
                      My father seeks thee through the town. 'Tis said <br>

                      On which poor courtier kingly smiles are turned, <br>

                      You find me in a flowing humor for our work. <br>
                      Hast thou performed the charge I gave thee ? <br>
                      <br>
                      GARIDEL. Yes <br>
                      <br>
                      I put the letter on her toilet table. <br>
                      <br>

                      But prithee, Master Aubry, why not use <br>
                      Some means more certain in effect to part <br>
                      These foolish lovers ? These letters, well wrought
                      <br>
                      And plausible, 'tis true, can they reduce <br>
                      Love's hottest flame ? They may cause some pouting
                      ; <br>
                      But oaths and tears soon quell the anger raised <br>

                      <br>

                      <br>
                      An honest fellow, and can I be sure <br>
                      That if I give thee all my confidence, <br>
                      Thou'lt not deceive me ? <br>
                      <br>
                      GAR. What, Master Aubry, <br>
                      <br>
                      And do you ask me that ? But yesterday <br>
                      We did acknowledge to each other <br>
                      That nature round our hearts had wound a tie <br>
                      Of sympathy. Have you not often said, <br>

                      That, in the darkness of my brow, there was <br>

                      The use of stronger measures 'gainst them ? True,
                      <br>
                      Villere has been a father to me. <br>
                      He found me, when an infant, in a ditch, <br>
                      Thrown there by an inhuman mother. <br>
                      He picked me up, and had me nursed with care, <br>
                      And, cheated by the fairness of my skin, <br>
                      He thought me one of Europe's sickly race, <br>
                      And did adopt me as his son, and strove <br>
                      To teach me science and morality. <br>
                      But now I am among his servants classed ; <br>
                      For soon as I grew up my figure changed ; <br>
                      And this black hair, and eye, and bronzed face <br>
                      Proclaimed me one of that dread tribe of men <br>
                      Whose birthplace is the undivided wild, <br>
                      Whose law is in the power of their arms, <br>
                      Whose hate is trusted to a poisoned knife, <br>
                      Whose thirst is for the white man's blood, <br>
                      And whose ambition is to sweep away <br>
                      Those pale usurpers of this land <br>
                      Who seek to pen the freeborn Indian up <br>
                      And set a bound'ry to his roving steps. <br>
                      Listen, Aubry ! I feel as if the red man's God <br>
                      Had cast my lot amidst thy race to be <br>
                      An agent of our nation's vengeance. <br>
                      Think ye I'll shrink from such a sacred task ? <br>
                      Though Villere still should call me his own son, <br>
                      I would begin with him. I'll end, perhaps, <br>
