At this stage of the military operations just described the main body of the Federal army, united at Goldsboroa, consisted of its right wing, under General Howard, aggregating 28,834 men; its left wing, under General Slocum, aggregating 28,063 men; its centre, under General Schofield, aggregating 26,392 men, exclusive of the artillery, numbering 2443 men, with 91 guns; and  the cavalry division, under General Kilpatrick, with an effective strength of 5659 men; making a grand aggregate of 91,391 men.
General Sherman's Memoirs, vol.
II., p. 334. Our addition differs from that of General Sherman, though made up from aggregates furnished by him. He finds 88,943—a difference of 2258.
It is easy to perceive that the error is not ours. This estimate does not include General Stoneman's force of cavalry, amounting to 4000, then operating around Greensboroa and Salisbury, and which, though not originally belonging to General Sherman's army, was then under his command.
General Sherman's Memoirs.
See his answer to General Johnston, vol.
II., p. 347  
For about fifteen days after its junction with General Schofield this army remained quiet near Goldsboroa, preparatory, as it appears, to the effort General Sherman was about to make to place it north of Roanoke River, and in full communication with the Army of the Potomac.
Ibid., vol.
II., p. 341.  
The small Confederate army, under General Johnston, stood between the two roads leading to Raleigh on the one hand, and to Weldon, on the other, so as to be ahead of the enemy on whichever line of march he might adopt, and in order, also, to be able to unite with the Army of Northern Virginia, in case General Lee should favor such a movement, although it was now, probably, too late to carry it out successfully.
The position was wisely selected.
Wheeler's cavalry was stationed north, and Butler's south, of the enemy's camps surrounding Goldsboroa. 
On the 1st of April, owing to a despatch just received from General Lee, empowering him to assume command of all troops from Western Virginia and Western North Carolina within his reach, General Beauregard left Greensboroa for Salisbury.
His purpose was, if possible, to confer with Generals Lee and Johnston relative to the actual condition of affairs, and the best disposition to be made of all available troops, from Salisbury to Greensboroa.
As Salisbury appeared to be less threatened than Greensboroa by the enemy's cavalry—Stoneman's—reported to be advancing from Mount Airy and Wytheville, in West Virginia— General Beauregard ordered three brigades, under Featherstone, Shelly, and Gowan, with two light batteries, to move, without delay, in the direction of Greensboroa, whither he returned the same evening.
Soon afterwards, Stoneman appearing more  directly to threaten Danville, which was then defended by a mere handful of troops, under General H. H. Walker, General Beauregard sent him Shelly's brigade, of some six hundred men, three batteries from Hillsboroa, and also ordered thither General Wheeler's cavalry, which had been sent by General Johnston to aid in the projected movement to oppose Sherman. 
Just at this time occurred the too long delayed and now inevitable evacuation of Richmond (April 2d), which, in General Johnston's opinion, necessitated the recall of Wheeler's force, as General Sherman, altering his purpose to form a junction with General Grant, might be tempted to march at once upon Smithfield and Raleigh.
Colonel J. F. Wheeler's cavalry was allowed, however, to proceed to Danville, where the Confederate Government had now determined to take temporary refuge, supposing— and indeed knowing—that General Lee, upon his retreat from Petersburg, would endeavor to reach Danville with his army.
Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, vol.
II., p. 668.  
The line of our defences around Petersburg was broken on the 2d of April, in the morning, and our troops were compelled to fall back on their inner works, thus making the evacuation of the city a mere question of hours. 
General Lee had advised that Richmond should be evacuated simultaneously with the withdrawal of his troops that night ;
Ibid., vol.
II., p. 661. and President Davis, informed of the disaster, began immediate preparations for his removal and that of the heads of the various State Departments from the capital of the Confederacy.
He says: The event had come before Lee had expected it, and the announcement was received by us in Richmond with sorrow and surprise; for, though it had been foreseen as a coming event which might possibly, though not probably, be averted, and such preparation as was practicable had been made to meet the contingency when it should occur, it was not believed to be so near at hand.
Ibid., vol.
II., p. 656 And here it is appropriate to say that, far from lamenting the abandonment of Richmond, to which it had clung with such blind pertinacity, the Government should have ordered it weeks, if not months, previously, when the military necessity for such a movement was clearly indicated as the best—and perhaps the only—method of salvation.
An effort to concentrate, at  this late hour, when every avenue of retreat was closed and the enemy had formed his junction and accomplished his purpose, was vain and useless. 
When this sad news reached General Beauregard—who on the day previous had received a confidential intimation of it—he was bitterly grieved; all the more, because he saw what the necessary result must now be. He was thoroughly convinced that the present hopeless strait could have been avoided had his counsel prevailed, when he urged the withdrawal of a portion of General Lee's army to strike Sherman's columns, then far from their base; and even later, about the 21st of February, when he again strenuously advised concentration at or near Salisbury, with a reinforcement of twenty thousand men from Generals Lee and Bragg, to defeat Sherman first, and attack Grant afterwards.
The battle of Bentonville had proved to General Beauregard that the spirit of the Confederate troops was unbroken, and that, with approximate equality in numbers, those troops could achieve victory.
It was now plain that the grand drama which had lasted for four years was fast drawing to an end. But he resolved, nevertheless, not to relax his efforts to uphold the cause until the last hour. 
On his return to Greensboroa, General Beauregard was greeted with kindness by its leading citizens, especially ex-Governor Morehead, whose hospitality he accepted, for himself and staff, during the remainder of his stay in that town. 
A system of light defensive works was now devised by General Beauregard for the protection of Greensboroa, which had become an important depot of supplies.
The troops temporarily detained there were called out to construct these defences, in which he caused to be placed a few field-pieces, procured from Hillsboroa, where they then lay, unsupplied with horses and of no use. 
The reports concerning Stoneman's raid indicated that he was moving from Wytheville, along the Virginia and Tennessee railroad, with a force of cavalry, variously estimated at from four to eight thousand men, and some light artillery; that a portion of this force had been thrown well out on his right flank, towards Wilkesboroa, Jonesville, Madison, etc., committing depredations on its way, and threatening the railroad from Salisbury to Danville, via Greensboroa; hence great alarm was felt in all these towns.
On the 4th of April, General Beauregard received a telegram from President Davis, and another on the 5th, both from Danville, making inquiry concerning the movements of the enemy, and approving the forwarding of cavalry, which, he said, would be of special value to that place, with the infantry already on its way to it. He also stated that he had had no news from General Lee for several days.
Neither General Johnston nor General Beauregard were better informed as to the movements of the Army of Northern Virginia, concerning which the greatest anxiety prevailed in all quarters.
Danville, now the temporary seat of Government, would have been guarded with the utmost care, in order to tranquillize Mr. Davis, had not the enemy's movements, since the fall of Richmond, required the presence of all our available forces with General Johnston.
This was explained to the President by a despatch from General Beauregard, dated Greensboroa, April 5th, 1865. 
The greatest energy was now used to hurry on the returned troops of Hood's army coming from Chester.
Fifteen hundred of them had left that place on the 6th, on their way to Smithfield.
And there being, in appearance, no further immediate danger threatening Greensboroa, General Beauregard, upon inquiring whether he should remain there and await other developments, received the following answer:  
 near Smithfield, April 6th, 1865. General G. T. Beauregard: 
It is not necessary to remain longer.
No news from General Lee. J. E.  Johnston.  
General Beauregard consequently returned, on the 7th, to Raleigh, which was, properly speaking, his headquarters at that time.
He was anxious to see and confer with General Johnston about the disastrous events which, from all sides, were now crowding upon the country; and, on the 8th, he started for Smithfield, where he and General Johnston exchanged views.
He returned during the same evening to Raleigh. 
On the day following this telegram, in cipher, was handed to General Beauregard:  
 Danville, April 9th, 1865. General G. T. Beauregard: 
General Walker, commanding here, desires your presence, in view of the probable concentration of forces from Thomas's army against this place at a very early period, and I think your services here will be more useful than at  any other point on the railroad line.
Please make the greatest possible despatch in coming, as a revision of the defensive lines is desirable. Jeffn. Davis.   
Before General Beauregard had had time to decide upon any course of action a second despatch came to him, in the following words:  
 Smithfield, April 9th, 1865. General G. T. Beauregard: 
The President wishes you to go to Danville immediately, to talk with him of general operations. J. E.  Johnston.  
This indicated great anxiety on the part of the President; and though he knew that the alleged danger of an attack by General Thomas's army on Danville, at that time, was purely imaginary, General Beauregard took immediate steps to obey Mr. Davis's behest.
He was on the point of starting, when he received from Colonel Otey, his Adjutant-General, at Greensboroa, the news of the capitulation of General Lee and his army on that day. The surrender of such an army, under such leaders, must necessarily cause discouragement and despair to settle upon the country.
It was easy to see that the remaining Confederate forces, wherever they might be, would soon have to follow the example of General Lee's army, as our resources were small in comparison with those of the enemy, which seemed to be steadily increasing, while ours were no less steadily diminishing.
Such were General Beauregard's thoughts, as he journeyed over the road to Greensboroa, on his way to Danville. 
Before reaching his destination, and supposing that the news from the Army of Northern Virginia might have caused other dispositions to be taken, he inquired (April 10th) of General Walker, if his presence was still necessary at Danville.The answer he received was an affirmative one; but almost at the same time came the following despatch from Colonel McLean, A. Q. M., in charge of the President's party:  
The President started for Greensboroa at 10 h. this evening, and would be glad to see you on his arrival.
Please give me every information about raiders.
Are Greensboroa and road now safe?  
General Beauregard's immediate answer was:  
Will await here arrival of President.
Road between this place and Danville safe.
Raiders are at or near Salem.  
He then without delay telegraphed General Ferguson to hurry up with his cavalry brigade, from High Point, as fast as he could.
The need of cavalry was greatly felt at that hour, not only to oppose the enemy, but to obtain trustworthy information.
General Beauregard had mostly to depend for the latter on the scouting parties, organized by him out of such volunteers as he could find, and sent in every direction. 
In view of General Beauregard's repeated changes of locality, from Salisbury to Raleigh, and his expected trip to Danville, he had concluded to establish his headquarters, for the future, in a box-car, so as to be always ready to move, at a moment's notice.
He gave orders accordingly, and was provided with three boxcars, one of which he used as his office, bedroom, and diningroom, the other for the movable portion of his staff, and the last for the horses. 
On arriving at Greensboroa he had these three cars put on a side-track, near the depot.
Early in the morning he was informed that the President's train, carrying himself, his Cabinet, and the Government officers, had arrived during the night, and was then close to his own. He crossed over to Mr. Davis's car, and, upon entering it, was struck by the helpless appearance of the gentlemen assembled there.
A warm welcome was given to General Beauregard, who could hardly find time to answer the rapid questions that were poured from all sides upon him, especially by the members of the Cabinet, with whom He was but slightly acquainted.
The President soon afterwards made his appearance.
He also extended a cordial greeting to General Beauregard; and, taking him aside, questioned him closely and anxiously about current military events.
The facts were far from encouraging, and General Beauregard had a gloomy account to give. 
He stated that Sherman, after the battle of Bentonville, had moved to Goldsboroa, where he had formed a junction with Schofield, and had re-supplied himself with all He required, and was now advancing with fully ninety-one thousand men on Smithfield, where was the greater part of General Johnston's force, amounting to less than twenty thousand infantry, and some four thousand cavalry, which had to be much scattered, in order to cover his front and flanks and protect his communications; that a very strong force of the enemy's cavalry,.under Stoneman, was  reported to be moving along the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, having already reached Wytheville, Christiansburg, and Salem, whence he was threatening our lines of communication, from Salisbury to Danville; and that he feared, every moment, to hear of his having broken these lines at some important point; that he, General Beauregard, was collecting at Salisbury, Greensboroa, and Danville all the remnants of the Army of Tennessee, still coming in, in small fractions, to rejoin their commands; that he was endeavoring to assemble the convalescents and furloughed men, as well as all the stragglers and deserters he could reach; that he was in great need of cavalry with which to defend our communications and ascertain the movements of the enemy, all his scouts and couriers being persons too old or too young to be very efficient, who had patriotically offered their services, furnishing their own horses and equipments; that he was, however, daily expecting General Ferguson's brigade of cavalry, which was coming from Augusta, Ga., as rapidly as possible, and, in all likelihood, would reach Graham that day. 
General Beauregard, in his conference with the President, also told him that, from Macon, General Cobb reported that the enemy's cavalry had penetrated North Alabama, from the Tennessee River, threatening Tuscaloosa, Selma, and Montgomery; while another force of cavalry, supported by infantry and artillery, was advancing, through North Georgia, on Atlanta, Columbus, and Macon, where He, General Cobb, had but few troops, principally local and State reserves, to oppose to them. 
He reported further that General Taylor confirmed the news of the Federal advance on Selma and Montgomery, and feared a movement from the Mississippi River, Memphis, and Vicksburg, through the interior of Mississippi, towards Okalona and Meridian; that a determined attack was soon to be expected on Mobile (as reported by General Maury, commanding there), from New Orleans and Pensacola, where there was a large increase of Federal troops; to oppose which General Maury had but an insignificant force under him. 
General Beauregard also said to Mr. Davis that the picture he presented to him was most gloomy, but that he thought it his duty to attempt no concealment of the truth, so that the President might have a clear knowledge of the situation, and be prepared for the inevitable.
President Davis lent an attentive ear to the account thus given of the hopeless condition of the Confederacy, but appeared, nevertheless, undismayed.
He said that the struggle could still be carried on to a successful issue, by bringing out all our latent resources; that if the worst came to the worst, we might, by crossing the Mississippi River, with such troops as we could retreat with, unite with Kirby Smith's army, which He estimated at some sixty thousand men, and prolong the war indefinitely.
General Beauregard did not expect, and was amazed at, this evidence of visionary hope on the part of the President.
He admired his confidence, but inwardly condemned what to him seemed to be a total want of judgment and a misconception of the military resources of the country. 
The President on that day (11th April), after his interview with General Beauregard, sent three telegrams to General Johnston, by way of Raleigh; one to General Walker, at Danville; and one to Governor Vance, also at Raleigh.
They fully indicate the state of Mr. Davis's mind at the time, and need no commentary:  
1. 
 Greensboroa, N. C., April 11th, 1865: 12 M. General J. E. Johnston, Headquarters, via Raleigh: 
The Secretary of War did not join me at Danville.
Is expected here this afternoon. 
As your situation may render best, I will go to your headquarters immediately after the arrival of the Secretary of War, or you can come here.
In the former case our conference must be without the presence of General Beauregard. 
I have no official report from General Lee.
The Secretary of War may be able to add to information heretofore communicated.
The important question first to be solved is, at what point shall concentration be made, in view of the present position of the two columns of the enemy and the routes which they may adopt to engage your forces before a prompt
The telegram in our files has the word prompt, as we have given it, instead of proposed, as written in Mr. Davis's book.
The meaning of the despatch is not altered by the use of either word. junction with General Walker and others?
Your more intimate knowledge of the data for the solution of the problem deters me from making a specific suggestion on that point.  Jeffn. Davis.  
2. 
 Greensboroa, N. C., April 11th, 1865:3.30 P. M. General J. E. Johston, Headquarters, via. Raleigh: 
The enemy's cavalry, in small force, this morning cut the Danville Railroad, ten miles from here, and, as reported, moved eastwardly.
Lest communication should be lost, I telegraph to say that General Beauregard proposes, after General Walker shall join him, which will be ordered to commence forthwith, to unite with you at the Yadkin, in front of Salisbury.
And this seems to me to be the most easy method, if pursued, of effecting the proposed junction.  Jeffn. Davis.  
3. 
 Greensboroa, N. C., April 11th, 1865. General J. E. Johnston, Headquarters, via Raleigh: 
Despatch of 1.30 P. M. received.
Secretary of War has not arrived.
To save time and have all information it is probably better that you come here.
In that event you will give the needful instructions to your second in command, and, if circumstances warrant, suspend the movement suggested in despatch of 3.30 P. M. for a time, which will enable you to communicate from here with that officer, or to indicate that the line has been broken by the enemy, so as to interrupt communication. Jeffn. Davis.  
4. 
 Greensboroa, N. C., April 11th, 1865. General H. H. Walker, Danville, Va.: 
The movements of the enemy in Eastern North Carolina indicate the necessity for prompt movement on your part to make a junction here with General Beauregard, and then with General Johnston, on the Yadkin, in front of Salisbury.
You will keep in communication with General Beauregard, on whose information the supposed necessity for your immediate action is based. Jeffn. Davis.  
5. 
 Greensboroa, N. C., April 11th, 1865. Governor Z. B. Vance, Raleigh, N. C.: 
I have no official report, but scouts, said to be reliable, and whose statements were circumstantial and corroborative, represent the disaster as extreme. 
I have not heard from General Lee since the 6th instant, and have little or no hope from his army as an organized body.
I expected to visit you at Raleigh, but am accidentally prevented from executing that design, and would be very glad to see you here, if you can come at once, or to meet you elsewhere in North Carolina at a future time.
We must redouble our efforts to meet present disaster.
An army holding its position with determination to fight on, and manifest ability to maintain the struggle, will attract all the scattered soldiers and daily rapidly gather strength. 
Moral influence is wanting, and I am sure you can do much now to revive the spirit and hope of the people. Jeffn. Davis.  
General Johnston was, just then, busily engaged in removing stores and supplies from Raleigh, and in order to do so with more celerity he asked General Beauregard to send him one hundred cars, which was done.
In his telegram, forwarded on that occasion, he also spoke of reinforcements (twelve hundred men of Pettus's brigade), which he was hurrying on to General  Beauregard for the additional safety of Greensboroa.
The necessity for such a movement was all the more urgent because, on the morning of that day (11th), the raiding cavalry had cut the Danville road, about twelve miles above Greensboroa, and had arrived in the afternoon at High Point and Jamestown, on the Salisbury road.
The damage done, however, was not great, and could easily be repaired. 
Acting under the powers given him by General Lee, in his despatch of April 1st, already referred to, General Beauregard was now issuing direct orders to Generals Lomax, Walker, and Bradley Johnson. Five hundred men were accordingly sent to Salisbury on the 12th, and minute instructions forwarded to General Lomax as to the best mode of saving supplies and of collecting his own as well as other cavalry commands for the protection of Greensboroa. 
General Johnston had also been summoned to Greensboroa by the President.
He arrived punctually, and at mid-day, on the 12th, after first consulting with General Beauregard, whose guest he then was, went, in his company, to meet Mr. Davis.
The latter was found at his temporary headquarters, with three members of his Cabinet—Messrs. Benjamin, Mallory, and Reagan.
After an exchange of formal courtesies, the President, without asking aught of the military condition in General Johnston's Department, or elsewhere, expressed his conviction that, by calling back the absentees and enlisting the men who had not, as yet, been reached by the Conscript Bureau, he could, in a few weeks' time, put a large army in the field, and thus enable us to go on with the struggle.
These were very much the same views that he had previously expressed to General Beauregard and to Governor Vance, and which were also embodied in his proclamation of April 5th.
Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, vol.
II., p. 677. Generals Johnston and Beauregard differed entirely from him, as neither could see the possibility, at that hour, of bringing these men into the ranks.
Here the conference rested, and was postponed to the next day, to await the arrival of the Secretary of War, General Breckinridge, whose presence was deemed necessary before any final action should be taken.
He came in the evening, and confirmed the news of General Lee's surrender.
Generals Johnston and Beauregard were now more than ever convinced that the  prolongation of hostilities with any hope of success was an impossibility; and that the only course left Mr. Davis while still, nominally, the Chief Magistrate of the Confederacy, was to open negotiations for peace.
This opinion was urged by General Johnston, in his own and in General Beauregard's name, at the renewal of the conference, on the 13th.
After asking the opinion of the members of the Cabinet present—General Breckinridge included —and receiving the assurance from all, except Mr. Benjamin, that they agreed with the two generals, Mr. Davis openly stated his objection, basing it mainly upon his belief that the Federal Government would refuse to treat with him, or accept any proposition he might offer.
It was then suggested by General Johnston that the preliminary overtures might be made by himself, and not by the President.
This, at last, was agreed to, and a letter, dictated by Mr. Davis, written by Mr. Mallory and signed by General Johnston, was handed to the latter, with authority to forward it to General Sherman. 
Thus closed the last official interview held between President Davis, General Johnston, and General Beauregard.
For further and confirmatory details concerning this conference the reader is referred to the Appendix to this chapter, where will be found a letter from General Johnston to General Beauregard (with the latter's endorsement), dated Baltimore, Md., March 30th, 1868.  
General Johnston lost no time in causing this letter to be forwarded to General Sherman.
It was intrusted to the care of Lieutenant-General Hampton, at or near Hillsboroa, and was, in obedience to his orders, delivered on the succeeding day. It read thus:  
The results of the recent campaign in Virginia have changed the relative military condition of the belligerents.
I am, therefore, induced to address you in this form the inquiry whether, in order to stop the further effusion of blood and devastation of property, you are willing to make a temporary suspension of active operations, and to communicate to Lieutenant-General Grant, commanding the armies of the United States, the request that he will take like action in regard to other armies; the object being to permit the civil authorities to enter into the needful arrangements to terminate the existing war.  
Except some raids of the Federal cavalry, at Salisbury and other minor points, in relation to which General Beauregard was yet issuing orders to Generals Lomax, Bradley Johnson, and Ferguson,  nothing of importance occurred from the 14th to the day of the meeting of Generals Johnston and Sherman.
The greater part of the Confederate forces, then temporarily under Lieutenant-General Hardee, was marching towards Greensboroa, where General Johnston's headquarters had been established.
The army proper was within a few miles of that place on the morning of the 16th. 
It is necessary to mention an occurrence of the day before, which, though in itself of no great importance, was the cause somewhat later of much complication and annoyance. 
Mr. John N. Hendren, Treasurer, C. S., as he signed himself, had been ordered by the President to turn over to General Beauregard, as a military chest to be moved with his army train, certain silver coin, estimated at $39,000, with the request that an officer should be designated to take charge of the sum and accompany its transfer to him by a schedule of ex-planation.
General Beauregard referred the matter to General Johnston, as was plainly the proper course to be pursued by him, and stated in his endorsement that the Secretary of War authorized the use of said coin for the wants of the army, in case of need.
See Appendix for letters of Mr. Hendren, and endorsement on them by General Beauregard. It appears—owing, no doubt, to General Johnston's absence at the time—that no immediate attention was paid to the matter, which greatly incensed the Treasurer, who thus brought upon himself a rather sharp reprimand from General Beauregard.
Further than that, the latter disclaims all personal knowledge of any incident connected with this money, or any other alleged to have been distributed at that period, except that, after the surrender, he and each member of his staff received, as a last payment—and the first for many months—the sum of $1.15, said to have formed part of the above-mentioned $39,000 in silver coin. 
General Sherman's answer, dated the 14th, met with some delay, and only reached General Johnston on the 16th.
It was as follows:  
I have this moment received your communication of this date.
I am fully empowered to arrange with you any terms for the suspension of further hostilities between the armies commanded by you and those commanded by myself, and will be willing to confer with you to that end. I will limit the advance of my main column to-morrow to Morrisville, and the cavalry to the  University, and expect that you will also maintain the present position of your forces until each has notice of a failure to agree. 
That a basis of action may be had, I undertake to abide by the same terms and conditions as were made by Generals Grant and Lee, at Appomattox Court-house, on the 9th instant, relative to our two armies; and, furthermore, to obtain from General Grant an order to suspend the movements of any troops from the direction of Virginia.
General Stoneman is under my command, and my order will suspend any devastation or destruction contemplated by him. I will add that I really desire to save the people of North Carolina the damage they would sustain by the march of this army through the central or western parts of the State.  
In accordance with this arrangement General Hardee was ordered to halt his command wherever it might be, and to draw his supplies from Greensboroa.
The same order to halt was extended to the other commands.
The officers to whom it was sent—General Hardee especially—were much concerned as to its meaning, and thought its effect would be detrimental to the troops, if it were not quickly explained.
To their inquiries and remarks General Beauregard's answer was, that he could not, just then, inform them of General Johnston's purpose; that the latter would, no doubt, do so himself, on his return from Hillsboroa; and that, meanwhile, the troops should be kept well in hand for rapid movement, at a moment's notice.
But that was a difficult task to perform.
The men knew they were on the eve of an extraordinary event; that something worse than a battle overhung them; that, like General Lee's forces, they also might at any hour be compelled to surrender; and they feared that they might thus lose their arms and whatever private property they might then be possessed of. This apprehension—which, we must admit, was a natural one—induced many a good and gallant soldier—especially in the cavalry—to abandon the ranks and start for home, without first obtaining permission to do so. Indeed, the whole army seemed to understand that they had fought their last fight; that the cause, for which they had so intrepidly struggled, was now lost; and that the sooner they were disbanded the better.
Their irregular manner of leaving the army, by hundreds and more at a time, was another argument against the sanguine expectations indulged in by Mr. Davis. 
Through General Hampton's instrumentality the time and place of meeting were arranged for the proposed conference between Generals Johnston and Sherman, who met, accordingly, at noon,  on the 17th, at Durham Station, some sixteen miles east of  Hillsboroa.
Nothing definite having been concluded at 2 o'clock P. M. on that day, it was agreed to adjourn until ten o'clock on the morning of the 18th. 
Just before the opening of the second day's conference General Beauregard sent to General Johnston the following suggestion, the substance of which we find embodied in article 2d of the terms of agreement about to be submitted to the reader:  
 Greensboroa, April 18th, 1865:8 A. M. General J. E. Johnston, near Hillsboroa, N. C.: 
Should your negotiations terminate favorably, let me suggest that you secure, if possible, the right to march our troops to their homes, and there muster them duly out of service, depositing their regimental colors in their respective State capitals for preservation.
The dotted words were written in cipher. G. T.  Beauregard.  
General Breckinridge, who had been telegraphed for by General Johnston, was present at the meeting of the 18th, but not in an official capacity, as General Sherman would have objected to that.
It was thought by General Johnston that, should the Secretary of War be with him during the negotiation, the Confederate Government would be more apt to ratify whatever terms might be agreed upon. 
After a long but courteous discussion, wherein General Breckinridge, more than once, expressed his opinion, the following paper was drawn up, accepted, and signed by the two Commanding Generals:  
Memorandum or basis of agreement made this 18th day of April, A. D. 1865, near Durham Station, in the State of North Carolina, by and between General Joseph E. Johnston, commanding the Confederate Army, and Major-General William T. Sherman, commanding the Army of the United States in North Carolina, both present. 
1st.
The contending armies now in the field to maintain the status quo until notice is given by the Commanding General of any one to its opponent, and reasonable time—say forty-eight (48) hours—allowed. 
2d.
The Confederate armies now in existence to be disbanded and conducted to their several State capitals, there to deposit their arms and public property in the State Arsenal; and each officer and man to execute and file an agreement to cease from acts of war, and to abide the action of the State and Federal authority.
The number of arms and munitions of war to be reported to the Chief of Ordnance, at Washington City, subject to the future  action of the Congress of the United States, and, in the mean time, to be used solely to maintain peace and order within the borders of the States respectively. 
3d.
The recognition, by the Executive of the United States of the several State Governments, on their officers and Legislatures taking the oaths prescribed by the Constitution of the United States, and, where conflicting State Governments have resulted from the war, the legitimacy of all shall be submitted to the Supreme Court of the United States. 
4th.
The re-establishment of all the Federal Courts in the several States, with powers as defined by the Constitution and laws of Congress. 
5th.
The people and inhabitants of all the States to be guaranteed, so far as the Executive can, their political rights and franchises, as well as their rights of person and property, as defined by the Constitution of the United States and of the States respectively. 
6th.
The Executive authority of the Government of the United States not to disturb any of the people by reason of the late war, so long as they live in peace and quiet, abstain from acts of armed hostility, and obey the laws in existence at the place of their residence. 
7th.
In general terms, the war to cease; a general amnesty, so far as the Executive of the United States can command, on condition of the disbandment of the Confederate armies, the disposition of the arms, and the resumption of peaceful pursuits by the officers and men hitherto composing said armies. 
Not being fully empowered by our respective principals to fulfil these terms, we individually and officially pledge ourselves to promptly obtain the necessary authority, and to carry out the above programme. 
J. E. Johnston, General Commanding Confederate States Army in North Carolina. 
W. T. Sherman, Major-General Commanding Army of the United States in North Carolina.  
General Breckinridge returned to Greensboroa on the 19th, and thence to Salisbury, carrying with him a copy of the liberal agreement to submit to the President, promising an immediate answer, which he hoped would be favorable; but which, nevertheless, was long delayed, owing to some unexplained objection on the part of Mr. Davis, and to the fact of his having gone to Charlotte, without waiting for the conclusion of the conference. 
Five days had elapsed since its termination, and still nothing was heard from President Davis. General Johnston had gone back to Greensboroa, and there had published General Orders No. 14, for a suspension of arms pending negotiations between the two Governments.
A like order had also been issued by General Sherman.  
Unable to account for such procrastination, General Johnston, on the 23d, forwarded the following telegram to General Breckinridge:  
General Sherman writes that he expects the return of his officer from Washington to-morrow.  
To this no answer came, but the result was that General Breckinridge saw the President, and also addressed him the following strong and urgent letter:  
 Charlotte, N. C., April 23d, 1865. To his Excellency the President: 
Sir,—In obedience to your request I have the honor to submit my advice on the course you should take upon the memorandum, or basis of agreement, made on the 18th instant, by and between General J. E. Johnston, of the Confederate States Army, and General W. T. Sherman, of the United States Army, provided that paper should receive the approval of the Government of the United States. 
The principal army of the Confederacy was recently lost in Virginia.
Considerable bodies of troops not attached to that army have either dispersed or marched towards their homes, accompanied by many of their officers.
Five days ago the effective force in infantry and artillery of General Johnston's army was but 14,770 men; and it continues to diminish.
That officer thinks it wholly impossible for him to make any head against the overwhelming forces of the enemy.
Our ports are closed, and the sources of foreign supply lost to us. The enemy occupy all or the greatest part of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina, and move almost at will to the east of the Mississippi.
They have recently taken Selma, Montgomery, Columbus, Macon, and other important towns, depriving us of large depots of supplies and of munitions of war. Of the small force still at command many are unarmed, and the Ordnance Department cannot furnish 5000 stand of small-arms.
I do not think it would be possible to assemble, equip, and maintain an army of 30,000 men at any point east of the Mississippi.
The contest, if continued after this paper is rejected, will be likely to lose entirely the dignity of regular warfare.
Many of the States will make such terms as they may; in others separate and ineffective hostilities may be prosecuted; while the war, wherever waged, will probably degenerate into that irregular and secondary stage, out of which greater evils will flow to the South than to the enemy. 
For these, and for other reasons which need not now be stated, I think we can no longer contend with a reasonable hope of success.
It seems to me that the time has arrived when, in a large and clear view of the situation, prompt steps should be taken to put a stop to the war. The terms proposed are not wholly unsuited to the altered condition of affairs.
The States are preserved, certain essential rights secured, and the army rescued from degradation. 
It may be said that the argreement of the 18th instant contains certain  stipulations which you cannot perform.
This is true, and it was well understood by General Sherman that only a part could be executed by the Confederate authorities.
In any case grave responsibilities must be met and assumed.
If the necessity for peace be conceded, corresponding action must be taken.
The modes of negotiation which we deem regular, and would prefer, are impracticable.
The situation is anomalous, and cannot be solved upon principles of theoretical exactitude.
In my opinion you are the only person who can meet the present necessities. 
I respectfully advise— 
1st.
That you execute, so far as you can, the second article of the agreement of the 18th instant. 
2d.
That you recommend to the several States the acceptance of those parts of the agreement upon which they alone can act. 
3d.
Having maintained with faithful and intrepid purpose the cause or the Confederate States while the means of organized resistance remained, that you return to the States and the people the trust which you are no longer able to defend. 
Whatever course you pursue, opinions will be divided.
Permit me to give mine.
Should these or similar views accord with your own, I think the better judgment will be that you can have no higher title to the gratitude of your countrymen and the respect of mankind than will spring from the wisdom to see the path of duty at this time, and the courage to follow it, regardless alike of praise or blame. 
Respectfully, and truly your friend,  John C.  Breckinridge, Secretary of War.     
Another telegram from General Johnston to the Secretary of War, following close upon this letter to the President, had, at last, the desired effect; and, on the 24th, from Charlotte, Mr. Davis wrote:  
  General J. E. Johnston, Greensboroa, N. C.:  
The Secretary of War has delivered to me the copy you handed to him of the basis of an agreement between yourself and General Sherman.
Your action is approved.
You will so inform General Sherman; and if the like authority be given by the Government of the United States to complete the arrangement, you will proceed on the basis adopted. 
Further instructions will be given as to the details of the negotiation and the methods of executing the terms of agreement when notified by you of the readiness on the part of the General commanding the United States forces to proceed with the arrangement.  Jefferson  Davis.     
Hardly had the foregoing communication been received by General Johnston, when two despatches were brought to him from General Sherman, the purport of which is clearly explained  in the following telegram to the Confederate Secretary of War:  
  Greensboroa, April 24th: 6.30 P. M. Hon. J. C. Breckinridge, Secretary of War:  
I have just received despatches from General Sherman informing me that instructions from Washington direct him to limit his negotiations to my command; demanding its surrender on the terms granted to General Lee, and notifying me of the termination of the truce in forty-eight hours from noon to-day.
Have you any instructions?
We had better disband this small force, to prevent devastation of country.  J. E.  Johnston, General.     
This news was disheartening in the extreme; and the stringent measures the Federal Government was now preparing to adopt were perhaps the result of the calamity that had befallen the South, no less than the North, in the assassination of President Lincoln.
Throughout every State of the then dying Confederacy there was but one feeling—that of abhorrence of the crime, and outspoken regret for its commission.
The idea that any Confederate, whether in the army or out of it, had, through a feeling of vengeance and with the approbation of the country, suggested, countenanced, or planned such an act of barbarism, could only be entertained by those who were ignorant of the history of that period, and of the characteristics of the Southern people.
Certainly Mr. Lincoln's sad end can no more be laid to the account of the Confederacy, or of any of those who formed part of its government, than the lamentable death of the late President Garfield can be attributed to the Republican party and its leaders.
The South knew that, had President Lincoln's life been spared, he would have ratified the treaty entered upon by the commanders of the two armies then in the field; for, as both General Sherman and Admiral Porter testify, he wanted peace on almost any terms, and his greatest desire was to get the men composing the Confederate armies back to their homes, at work on their farms and in their shops.
General Sherman's Memoirs, vol.
II., p. 326. See also Admiral Porter's Account of General Sherman's Interview with Mr. Lincoln, Ibid., pp. 328, 329. It was the overstrained, embittered zeal of the new Federal Administration—born of a double crime, murder and apostasy—that destroyed in its bud the work of peace and reunion, so ably and liberally prepared —to their honor be it said—by Generals Johnston and Sherman.  
Apparently, the Secretary of War did not understand the meaning of General Johnston's last despatch to him; or his views might have been altered by exterior pressure, for he was then at Charlotte, with Mr. Davis, who was still bent on organizing a cavalry force to escort him and his party to the Southwest. 
General Breckinridge answered:  
  Charlotte, N. C., April 24th, 1865:11 P. M. General J. E. Johnston, Greensboroa, N. C.:  
Does not your suggestion about disbanding refer to the infantry and most of the artillery?
If it be necessary to disband these, they might still save their small-arms and find their way to some appointed rendezvous.
Can you not bring off the cavalry and all the men you can mount from the transportation and other animals, with some light field-pieces?
Such a force could march away from Sherman, and be strong enough to encounter anything between us and the Southwest.
If this course be possible, carry it out and telegraph your intended route.  John C.  Breckinridge, Secretary of War.     
This reached General Johnston on the 25th.
His reply was prompt and energetic.
It deserves attention and respect:  
  Greensboroa, April 25th: 10 A. M. Hon. J. C. Breckinridge, Secretary of War:  
Your despatch received.
We have to save the people, save the blood of the army, and save the high civil functionaries.
Your plan, I think, can only do the last. 
We ought to prevent invasion, make terms for our troops, and give an escort of our best cavalry to the President, who ought to move without loss of a moment.
Commanders believe the troops will not fight again.
We think your plan impracticable.
Major-General Wilson, U. S. A., has captured Macon, with Major-Generals Cobb and G. W. Smith, Brigadiers Mackall and Mercer, and the garrison.
Federal papers announce capture of Mobile, with three thousand prisoners.  J. E.  Johnston, General.     
No answer was given to this.
General Johnston received neither orders nor instructions from Mr. Davis after the latter's communication of the 24th of April.
His memory serves him amiss if it suggests otherwise—unless General Breckinridge's telegram of the 25th to General Johnston can be considered as an answer from the President; but that, as must be evident to the reader, was not an answer to the foregoing despatch. 
It was because nothing was heard from the President or the Secretary of War that, again, on the 25th, at 11.30 A. M., General Johnston telegraphed as follows:   
 Hon. J. C. Breckinridge, Secretary of War: 
I have proposed to General Sherman military negotiations in regard to this army.    
This was done after due consultation with General Beauregard, who thoroughly approved General Johnston's course, and thought it imperative that some positive and immediate step should be taken, to extricate the army and its commanders from the desperate position in which they were placed. 
The same unaccountable silence was maintained on the part of what was still called the Government of the Confederate States. General Johnston and General Beauregard were forced to conclude that Mr. Davis was unwilling to assume any further responsibility, and wished to transfer its weight to their shoulders.
They were not deterred by this consideration, however, and General Johnston, in harmony with General Beauregard, at 7 A. M., on the 26th, sent a third telegram to the Secretary of War, in these terms: I am going to meet General Sherman at the same place.
The meeting was held, and the following terms agreed upon by Generals Johnston and Sherman, without any difficulty whatever:  
Terms of a military convention entered into this twenty-sixth (26th) day of April, 1865, at Bennett's House, near Durham's Station, N. C., between Joseph E. Johnston, commanding the Confederate army, and Major-General W. T. Sherman, commanding the United States army, in North Carolina. 
1. All acts of war on the part of the troops under General Johnston's command to cease from this date. 
2. All arms and public property to be deposited at Greensboroa, and delivered to an ordnance officer of the United States army. 
Rolls of all the officers and men to be made in duplicate; one copy to be retained by the Commander of the troops, and the other to be given to an officer to be designated by General Sherman.
Each officer and man to give his individual obligation, in writing, not to take up arms against the Government of the United States until properly released from this obligation. 
4. The side-arms of officers and their private horses and baggage to be retained by them. 
5. This being done, all the officers and men will be permitted to return to their homes: not to be disturbed by the United States authorities so long as they observe their obligation and the laws in force where they may reside.  J. E.  Johnston, Genl. Comdg. Confed. States forces in N. C. W. T. Sherman, Maj.-Genl. Comdg. United States forces in N. C.     
Additional terms were agreed upon the next day between General Johnston and General Schofield, who had been empowered to complete all necessary arrangements relative to the surrender.
We ask attention to General Sherman's letter to that effect, in the Appendix. 
The supplemental terms were as follows: 
1. The field transportation to be loaned to the troops for their march to their homes, and for subsequent use in their industrial pursuits.
Artillery horses may be used in field transportation, if necessary. 
2. Each brigade or separate body to retain a number of arms equal to one-seventh of its effective strength, which, when the troops reach the capitals of their States, will be disposed of as the General commanding the Department may direct. 
3. Private horses, and other private property, for both officers and men, to be retained by them. 
4. The Commanding General of the Military Division of West Mississippi, Major-General Canby, will be requested to give transportation by water, from Mobile to New Orleans, to the troops from Arkansas and Texas. 
5. The obligations of officers and soldiers to be signed by their immediate commanders. 
6. Naval forces within the limits of General Johnston's command to be included in the terms of this convention.  J. E.  Johnston, Genl. Comdg. Confed. States forces in N. C. J. M. Schofield, Maj.-Genl. Comdg. United States forces in N. C.   
Not knowing, on the 27th, where the President or the Secretary of War could be found, General Johnston addressed the following despatch to Brigadier-General Echols (whom he believed to be at Charlotte), through Colonel Hoke, then commanding that post:  
A military convention has been made by General Sherman and myself terminating hostilities between our commands.
Send intelligence to Secretary of War, if you can, and give the information to Major-General Stoneman. 
This telegram, and those preceding, to and from General Breckinridge, as also his letter to President Davis (April 23d), are copied from files of the late Secretary of War of the Confederate States, now in the possession of his son, Major Clifton R. Breckinridge.  
Colonel Hoke, in transmitting the message to the Secretary of War, added:  
I have sent a flag of truce with a letter of General Cooper to General Stoneman.  
The fact is patent that the Confederate Government (or those who formerly constituted it) abandoned Generals Johnston and Beauregard, and the forces under them, in their extremity, without advice or instructions, and without any information whatever concerning its whereabouts or its intended movements.
The truth is, that at the time we speak of Generals Johnston and Beauregard represented the only Confederate organization then in existence in the East.
They fully realized the fact, and knew that nothing could be gained by hesitation or delay with an adversary so conversant as General Sherman was with the exact condition of affairs in his front.
Hence General Johnston's determined action.
His circular to the Governors of the surrounding States explains the motives actuating him.
See Appendix.  
What would have become of the Confederate forces under Generals Johnston and Beauregard, what height of demoralization would the army not have reached, had General Johnston waited for authority to act from the President, whose only care at that juncture appeared to be to seek personal safety in flight?
His efforts to organize, and fit out a large cavalry escort
Mr. Davis gives the number of men forming it as about two thousand, representing six brigade organizations.
（Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, vol.
II., pp. 689, 690.) for himself and suite are only partially excused by attributing them to trepidation and bewilderment.
The letter of General Breckinridge to Mr. Davis, dated May 3d, gives a melancholy account of the demoralized condition of the body-guard of the President's party.
Nothing can be done with the bulk of this command, said General Breckinridge. It has been with difficulty that anything has been kept in shape.
I am having the silver paid to the troops, and will in any event save the gold and have it brought forward in the morning, when I hope Judge Reagan will take it. Many of the men have thrown away their arms.
Most of them have resolved to remain here, under Vaughn and Dibbrell, and will make terms.
A few hundred men will move on, and may be depended on for the object we spoke of yesterday.
The entire letter is given in the Appendix.  
President Davis seems to have been unconscious of the fact that he was not in the position of a Charles Stuart, or any other monarch, fleeing from his country and from rebellious subjects, who  believed he had the inherent right to sacrifice the lives of his followers in efforts to insure his individual safety.
As soon as the Confederacy was overthrown—and it was virtually so when General Lee surrendered at Appomattox—Mr. Davis became a private citizen.
Had he then wisely accepted that position and left the country (as General Breckinridge and Mr. Benjamin did, after the fall of General Johnston's army), using his own means to do so, and unbetrayed by official display, he would, undoubtedly, have escaped both capture and imprisonment, and would have been spared the stories circulated at the time, which, false though most of them were, went far to impair his dignity. 
General Beauregard, in accordance with instructions from General Johnston, had again stopped all further movements of our troops, and informed the Federal officer commanding the 6th Corps, at or near Danville, that the truce had been resumed between the two contending armies.
The following order was then published to the Confederate forces:  
  Headquarters, Army of Tennessee, near Greensboroa, N. C., April 27th, 1865.  
General orders, no. 18: 
By the terms of a military convention made on the 26th instant, by Major-General W. T. Sherman, U. S. A., and General J. E. Johnston, C. S. A., the officers and men of this army are to bind themselves not to take up arms against the United States until properly relieved from that obligation, and shall receive guarantees from the United States officers against molestation by the United States authorities, so long as they observe that obligation and the laws in force where they reside. 
For these objects duplicate muster-rolls will be made immediately, and, after the distribution of the necessary papers, the troops will march, under their officers, to their respective States, and there be disbanded, all retaining personal property. 
The object of this convention is pacification to the extent of the authority of the Commanders who made it. 
Events in Virginia, which broke every hope of success by war, imposed on its General the duty of sparing the blood of this gallant army and saving our country from further devastation and our people from ruin.  J. E.  Johnston, General. Official. Kinloch  Falconer, A. A. G.

As soon as the work of arranging and verifying the muster-rolls and other papers relative to the return of the troops to their respective States had been completed, General Beauregard, released from these sad but necessary duties, turned his thoughts to his own personal affairs and his approaching departure for Louisiana.
He had, on the 27th of April, addressed an affectionate farewell letter to the officers of his personal and general staff, which we have already inserted in the biographical sketch immediately preceding the narrative of his military operations.
We append a list of their names :
A complete list of the staff, and of all detached officers and men serving at General Beauregard's headquarters, up to the 1st of May, is given in the Appendix.

During the war General Beauregard had exerted himself to the utmost to have additional rank given to staff-officers who, in his opinion, were worthy of promotion.
He thought that a full general should be entitled, in war, to four aides-de-camp—a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, a major, and a captain.
Instead of which two aids only, with the rank of lieutenant, had been allowed a full general, according to law. During the winter of 1864-1865 Congress, however, at last passed a bill giving three aids, with the rank of major, to every full general.
But the law, as was well known, was never enforced by the War Department.
Fearing lest the Confederacy should die without doing at least partial justice to that faithful and self-sacrificing class of officers, General Beauregard addressed the following telegram to Adjutant-General Cooper, who at that date was still at Charlotte:  
  Greensboroa, N. C., April 28th, 1865:7.30 A. M.  
Before leaving here the Secretary of War promised to have General Johnston's aids and mine commissioned majors, according to law. Has it been done?
It is highly desirable it should be done before disbanding troops.
I am glad to hear of Lieutenant-Colonel Riley's promotion.  G. T.  Beauregard.     
General Cooper's answer was forwarded and duly received the same day. It ran thus:  
  Charlotte, April 28th, 1865. General G. T. Beauregard:  
The Secretary of War and myself strongly recommended to the President the promotion of yours and General Johnston's aides-de-camp; and though the matter was considered by him, the order for their promotion was not given.
He has left, and I am powerless to effect your wishes.
It would give me pleasure if I could.  S.  Cooper, A. and I. G.     
While at Charleston, General Beauregard had also recommended many of his officers as deserving of promotion for gallant and meritorious services during the long and remarkable siege of that city; but none of them were promoted save two—namely, Major (afterwards Brigadier-General) Stephen D. Elliott, one of the commanders of Sumter after its first intrepid defender, Colonel Rhett, had been withdrawn from the unconquered fortress, with all its heavy artillery; and Major D. B. Harris, the able and indefatigable Engineer, who was made a lieutenant-colonel, and was even promoted to the rank of brigadier-general, though he died without being apprised of the fact.
The others remained unnoticed until the very last moment during the expiring hours of the Confederacy, when, at General Beauregard's solicitation to the Secretary of War, two of them, by going to Charlotte, N. C., in person, obtained deserved promotion.
The first, Brigadier-General Taliaferro, was thus made Major-General; and the second, Captain F. D. Lee, who had been in charge of the Torpedo Department at Charleston, became a major.
This was tardy justice; and it is surprising, when we remember the confusion prevailing at that time in the Executive Bureaus, that even so much was obtained. 
As an illustration of the intense preoccupation then existing among some of the high civil functionaries of the defunct Government, General Beauregard relates that, shortly after the President had left Greensboroa for Salisbury and Charlotte, he noticed at the depot, at Greensboroa, a train of box-cars, from one of which some straggling soldiers were throwing out papers which were flying to and fro in every direction.
Upon inquiry it was ascertained that these cars contained the official records of the Government from Richmond, and had been abandoned there, without a guard, and without directions as to the disposition to be made of them.
General Beauregard gave orders at once that sentinels should be put over them, and that they should be immediately forwarded to Charlotte; which was done.
He afterwards learned that General Johnston, on arriving at that place, found these cars again unprotected, and that he also took special pains to have them properly guarded.
They were finally turned over to the Federal authorities, in order to prevent further destruction. 
It was only on the 30th of April that General Beauregard was able to begin preparations for his homeward journey.
He had collected from Greensboroa all the Louisianians who were there  on detached service, separated from their commands, and had invited them to join his staff and to return with him to New Orleans.
He thus got together about twenty of them, who gratefully accepted his kind offer; and on the 1st of May, at 10.30 P. M., after making his adieus to those members of his general staff whose route lay in a different direction, to General Johnston, to his military household, and to many officers who had not yet left, he started, with his party, travelling sometimes by rail, sometimes on horseback, and sometimes even—for the few who had no horses—on foot. 
General Beauregard felt the difficulty of procuring the necessary funds for defraying his own and his companions' expenses on the journey.
Except the silver coin ($1.15 each) which had been given to himself, his staff, and the troops, as already related, neither General Beauregard nor those who accompanied him had any money in specie; and even Confederate notes, which had become altogether valueless, were scarce among them. 
But one of General Beauregard's aids, Lieutenant Chisolm, who was seldom at a loss for resources in an emergency, proposed that a wagon should be procured and stocked with provisions and stores, such as tobacco, nails, yarn, twine, thread, and whatever else the people along their route were likely to be in need of, and that these articles should be used in lieu of money.
The suggestion was adopted; and as the quartermaster and the commissary of the post had received orders to distribute their supplies on hand to the several commands, the wagon was soon loaded as desired, and the plan of barter, when tried upon the journey, surpassed the most sanguine expectations.
The people on the way were happy to secure these useful commodities in return for what few provisions they could spare.
It is our duty to add that, however poor or helpless the people were, as soon as they learned that what they were asked to barter was needed by General Beauregard and his staff, they almost invariably refused to accept any compensation whatever.
This was carried so far that General Beauregard, although deeply touched by it, had to forbid his name being mentioned until the exchange had been entirely effected and the goods carried off. 
To show the patriotism of the Southern people—notably of the women—even at that hour, an incident may be mentioned which occurred just before General Beauregard and his companions  reached the South Carolina and Georgia border.
They had come to a small town, and were relating the latest news of the surrender of our armies to the inhabitants, who had rushed to the road to obtain what they knew would be trustworthy information.
There, as everywhere, they heard it with great sorrow.
Old men—for no others were there—and women of all ages, of all classes, shed tears as they took General Beauregard's hand and asked him if he really thought the struggle was over forever.
Among those present was a tall, gaunt old lady, who, although sunburned and with hands hardened by toil, had an unmistakable air of culture and refinement.
She took the general warmly by the hand, the tears meanwhile running down her furrowed cheeks, and said, General, is there no longer any hope of success None, madame, was the answer; we have fought our last fight, and must now submit bravely to our hard fate.
Ah! General, I lost four brave, manly sons in this war, and I have but one left, my youngest, but I would have given his life too for the triumph of our cause!
No Roman matron could have spoken more nobly. 
On arriving at Newberry, S. C., on the 5th of May, General Beauregard told those officers of his staff who were citizens of South Carolina that they must now leave him and return to their families.
They strongly objected, and insisted upon accompanying him until he should have reached his home in safety.
This he positively refused to allow; for travelling was then very difficult, especially in Georgia, owing to the destruction of the railroads; and he was unwilling that they should put themselves to so much inconvenience on his account.
They yielded, therefore, though reluctantly, and on the next morning (May 6th) finally parted from the General, after a most affectionate leave-taking.
Four years of toil and dangers, shared together, had cemented between them a friendship which no after-event could possibly impair. 
General Beauregard and the remainder of his party arrived at Augusta, Ga., during the afternoon of the 8th, after passing through Charlotte, N. C., Rockhill, Newberry, Edgefield, and Hamburg, S. C. He had stopped at Edgefield on the morning of the 7th to pay a parting visit to Governor Pickens, whose residence stood just outside of the town.
At the Governor's kind and pressing invitation he and his staff remained there an entire day.  
General Beauregard prolonged his stay in Augusta several days, for the sake of the rest he so much needed after the fatigue and emotions of the last few weeks.
He then started by rail for Atlanta, which he had not seen since the destruction of the town by General Sherman's army.
Of that handsome and fast-growing city there remained but a few houses standing here and there on its outskirts.
Only blackened walls and chimneys now marked the alignments of the streets.
It was a relief to General Beauregard when the train left for West Point, which was then the terminus of the railroad, since the destruction by Wilson's cavalry of that part of the track running to Montgomery.
From West Point he went across country to Montgomery, then occupied by Federal troops under Major-General A. J. Smith, a former friend and classmate of General Beauregard at the United States Military Academy.
This was on the 17th of May. General Smith did all in his power to assist General Beauregard in his further journey southward. 
Mobile was reached on the 19th. General Beauregard went directly from the railroad depot to the steamer by which he was to leave for New Orleans.
He refused to stop in the city, in order to avoid the visits of a number of Confederate officers and men, who, he was told, proposed calling on him. The fear of involving them in trouble with the Federal authorities was his reason for depriving himself of the pleasure of meeting them once more. 
There were now but a few hours intervening before General Beauregard would again set foot in Louisiana.
When about to enter upon this last stage of his long journey he could not help painfully noting the difference between the feeling, the tone, and the outward appearance of the people four years before, when he was on his way to take command in Charleston, and that which he now felt and saw around him. Free, resolute, hopeful were the masses then; sorrowful, despondent, heart-broken he found them now. Johnston's army after Lee's, Taylor's after Johnston's, had surrendered.
The Trans-Mississippi forces, under Kirby Smith, must soon do the same.
It was for them a question not even of days but of hours.
None, except perhaps Mr. Davis, could then imagine that General Kirby Smith was capable of making a stand in the Trans-Mississippi country and of continuing there to uphold our cause.
The great resources of his Department, its vast extent, the numbers, the discipline, and the efficiency  of his army
Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, vol.
II., p. 697.—words copied from General Kirby Smith's order of April 21st to his forces—were in striking contrast with his refusal, and his reasons given at the time for refusing,
See his letter to General Beauregard, in Appendix to Chapter XLII., wherein he wrote, under date of January 6th, 1865: * * * The country has been so devastated by the contending armies, and is so exhausted, that the troops would require transportation for supplies for near three hundred miles from the interior to the Mississippi. * * * The country north of Red River is bare of supplies, and is at this season utterly impracticable for the operations of armies and the movement of troops.
More than two hundred miles of destitution intervene between our supplies and the enemy's works on the Arkansas.
Near five hundred miles of desert separate our base on Red River from the productive region of Missouri, etc. to send assistance to General Hood, in his hard campaign around Nashville, after the battle of Franklin. Mr. Davis had, no doubt, forgotten the expression of opinion of the War Department (December 4th, 1864) concerning General Kirby Smith: that he had heretofore failed to respond to many calls made on him, and that no plans should be based on his compliance.
See, in Appendix, Mr. Seddon's telegram to General Beauregard.   
General Beauregard also bitterly reflected upon General Sherman's long and slow march, from Atlanta to Savannah, from Savannah to Goldsboroa, and from Goldsboroa to Raleigh, a distance of 650 miles, which it had taken him 109 days, or an average of six miles a day, to accomplish.
He knew that this had been effected, without material opposition, because of want of forethought on the part of the officers of the War Department, from whom no reinforcements could be obtained, and by reason of whose apathy no concentration could be made at any point, notwithstanding his repeated and urgent appeals.
And what added keenness to his regret was the recollection that, had General Hood crossed the Tennessee River at Guntersville when he should have done so, he would have had ample time to destroy the scattered Federal forces in that part of the State, take Nashville, with all the supplies there collected, and march to the Ohio, without encountering serious obstacles.
Or possibly he might, after taking Nashville, have crossed the Cumberland Mountains and gone to form a junction with General Lee, so as to strike General Grant before General Sherman could come to his assistance.
The success of either movement might have compelled General  Sherman to follow the Confederate forces into Middle Tennessee; thus showing the correctness of General Hood's original plan, which, though badly executed, was, nevertheless, undoubtedly well conceived. 
On the 20th of May, General Beauregard and his party arrived at the Pontchartrain end of the new canal and shell road, five miles in rear of New Orleans.
There he was informed that crowds of people were anxiously awaiting his return to greet his passage through the city.
Acting under the same impulse, and for the same reasons that led him to avoid all public demonstration in Mobile, he determined at once to reach his residence through the most retired streets.
But he was only partially successful in doing so, for even there, wherever he appeared, men, women, and children flocked out from their houses, waving their handkerchiefs and pressing around his horse to shake the General by the hand.
He could find no words to say in response, but was most deeply moved by such a spontaneous outburst of sympathy and affection.
And thus, as the sun was setting in the west, he finally came to his once happy home, left more than four years before, to find—as he feelingly said—a seat vacant that formerly was occupied by one who had never heard his footsteps at the door without hastening to welcome him to his own fireside.

In bringing this book to a close it may be pertinent and profitable to the reader in search of truth, to pass briefly in review the management of the Confederate government in several matters vitally affecting the issue of the cause.
To do this it is necessary to note our success or failure in providing the ways and means of defence.
These consisted: first, in the importation of arms and munitions of war from Europe; second, in the purchase of a navy; third, in the financial operations of the government; fourth, in its diplomacy with foreign nations, especially England and France.
As a result following the action of the administration in these particulars, it is important to observe the progressive failure of the government in defending the territory, population, and supplies of the Southern States.
With correct ideas on these subjects  and a knowledge of public opinion and feeling concerning the management of Confederate affairs, the materials will be present for judging of the causes which led to the disastrous end. Thus is the web of fate woven.
But, in touching upon these grave topics, which control military events and shape history, no more can be attempted here than a brief, if suggestive, outline. 
1. It was patent to every man of intelligence in the country that arms, ammunition, accoutrements, soldiers' clothing, shoes, and blankets must be procured from Europe.
The Confederate government was established in February, 1861.
War was declared in the latter part of April.
During three months there was not the slightest obstacle to the obtainment of arms and munitions.
And, after declaration of war, the laws of nations authorized the citizens of neutral powers to sell to belligerents articles contraband of war, and to supply gunpowder and every description of arms.
These laws were specifically confirmed by decrees of the courts of England and of the United States.
Neutrality and a recognition of the belligerent rights of the Confederate States were soon assured by England, France, and other nations of Europe.
And the blockade attempted of the Southern seaports was, for six months, no more than nominal, and thereafter very imperfect, to say the least of it, up to the close of the war. 
On the 1st of May, 1861, the British Minister at Washington was informed by the Secretary of State, Mr. Seward, that he had sent agents to England, and that others would go to France, to purchase arms for the United States.
This fact was communicated to the British Foreign Office, which interposed no objection.
The government of the United States managed to receive in safety all the warlike supplies which it induced British manufacturers and merchants to send, and its arsenals were replenished from British sources.
A reference to the bills of entry in the custom-houses of London and Liverpool shows that from May 1st, 1861, to December 31st, 1862, vast shipments of implements of war were made to the Northern States.
The official customhouse returns set forth that 341,000 rifles, 41,500 muskets, 26,500 flint guns, 49,982,000 percussion-caps, and 2250 swords were exported to the North.
And from one-third to one-half as much more was shipped as hardware.
Meantime, the head of the Confederate administration, elected on account of his acquaintance with military no less than civil affairs,  a graduate of West Point, distinguished as a colonel in the Mexican war, and afterwards Secretary of War, and familiar with the personnel of the United States army—a man who expressed his conviction that the North would certainly make war upon the South, and urged military preparations for defence—picked out Major Caleb Huse and sent him to England, as agent, to purchase arms.
Major Huse was also a graduate of West Point, of the class of 1847, from Newburyport, Mass., and, since the war, has been, and still is, principal of a preparatory school at West Point, N. Y. He did not go abroad until after war was declared, and ran the blockade from the harbor of Charleston, with instructions to buy ten thousand (!) rifles.
See Chapter V., Vol.
I. On the 30th of December, 1861, he wrote: Not able to send anything.
It seems, however, to have been held by the Confederate administration that Major House displayed prodigious energy when he sent the information that he had in a warehouse at St. Andrew's Wharf, Liverpool, 25,000 rifles, 2000 barrels of powder, 500,000 cartridges, 13,000 accoutrements, 226 saddles, with blankets, socks, etc.; these guarded by government watchmen, and the wharfingers ordered not to ship or deliver without acquainting the Board of Customs.
So much for the commercial caution and skill of this select agent, whose repute is assuredly that of an estimable citizen, but not that of an active, enterprising, and practical man. If there were other agents sent to Europe by the Confederate government to purchase and ship arms the fact has not been published.
The competent agency of John Frazer & Co., of Liverpool, might have been obtained by the government, and that of Confederate officers, one or more, who furnished the Russian government with arms during the Crimean war of 1855, and had information of the available arms in Europe.
But their knowledge and experience were not utilized.
Most of the wholly insufficient supply of arms that was obtained came through the private enterprise of merchants shipping at their own risk, and were sold to the government after landing.
A large number were also acquired by capture on the fields of battle. 
While the timely importation of what we sorely needed from abroad received comparatively insignificant and inefficient attention, the energies and agents of the administration seemed chiefly occupied in the preparation, within the Confederate States, of  nitre beds and other elaborate arrangements, which required time, and therefore accomplished little before the tide of war was fatally turned against us. 
Of men willing to engage in the defence of their country Mr. Davis himself testifies there were many more than the government could arm. There were very many out of the army who were anxious to enter it, but for whom the government had no arms.
Three hundred and sixty thousand offered their services to the government before it moved from Montgomery, at the end of May, 1861.
In 1862 accepted regiments were encamped at Richmond which had been awaiting their arms for several months.
The chief anxiety of General Albert Sidney Johnston at Bowling Green was to procure arms and men. Half of his troops were imperfectly armed, and whole brigades remained without weapons during the autumn of 1861.
Importunate cries went up to the government from the West for the supplies which would enable patriotic citizens to defend their homes.
Here, there, everywhere, the difficulty of the Confederate administration was the want of arms.
The first Secretary of War, General L. P. Walker, after vainly urging the importation of arms by the hundred thousand, resigned, because it was determined by the President not to put into camps of instruction, for the campaign of 1862, the large number of troops on which the Secretary insisted. 
2. In the procurement of a navy the Confederate administration was not more successful.
An appropriation of ten millions of dollars in bonds, invested in cotton, would have enabled the Government to obtain a sufficient number of first-class steamships, to prevent a blockade; and such a proposition was actually made to it. When the East India Company surrendered to the Crown its control of British India it had for sale a fleet of swift and stout steamers, built for armament, to secure the Company's interests in the Indian seas, and for long voyages.
These vessels, of great size and power (then recently built) were ten in number— four first-class, and six, for our purposes, scarcely inferior.
They could have been bought in England at less than one-half the cost, and could have been equipped, manned, armed, and put on the coast of the United States within six months after the formation of the Confederate government 
See Chapter V., Vol.
I.—that is, by August or September,  1861—for $10,000,000, or covered by 40,000 bales of cotton.
The owners were willing to receive cotton or such other payment as might be convenient.
Mr. Charles K. Prioleau, of the Liverpool branch of the house of John Frazer & Co., made this negotiation of his own accord;
See Mr. Prioleau's letter to General Beauregard, in Chapter V., Vol.
I. and an agent of the firm went from Charleston, S. C., to Montgomery with his proposition, that the Confederate government should buy these vessels on the terms mentioned.
But the proposal was declined.
This occurred about three months after the organization of the Confederate government, and constitutes a strange commentary upon the predictions of a terrible war, and the anxiety of Mr. Davis to prepare for it. Mr. Prioleau is a man of high standing, socially and commercially, and the correctness of his statements cannot be doubted. 
The season of 1860 was a fine one for cotton, and a large crop was made.
The people of the Cotton States were prosperous and rich.
There were very many who did not need their crops for their immediate support, and there were very many who had money for investment.
Although a good deal of cotton was shipped abroad, as usual, a considerable amount was held in the interior, and it was freely at the disposal of the government in exchange for its bonds, payable at a distant day. Recognizing the importance of preventing the closure of the Southern ports, it was early proposed and urged by men of prominence to purchase cotton with bonds of the Confederate States.
VicePresi-dent Stephens suggested 2,000,000 bales of the crop of 1860, and 2,000,000 more from the crop of 1861.
With this cotton, or any considerable part of it, either got out before the ports could be effectually closed by blockade, or in hand and pledged, a large number of the best steamers, ironclads or others, could have been bought, or contracted for and built, in Europe.
This line of policy would have enabled the government to procure a number of ships by the end of 1861, and in no long time a navy vastly superior to that of the United States.
The blockade might have been prevented, and Northern shipping—which was the weak point of the North—might have been swept from the ocean; all the cotton we had to export might have been convoyed across the sea; all needed supplies might have been procured; the credit of the Confederate States might have been established, while that  of the United States might have been crippled, by the prevention of duties from imports and exports; and, by the development of such power and resources, the Confederate States might have secured the recognition of their established place among the independent nations of the world.
But the administration failed to discover the true policy, or had not the capacity and energy to carry it out. That which is highly practicable for some men is wholly impracticable for others.
Hence, the successes and failures that checker life mark the difference between men of eminent competence and those who bear the brand of signal incompetence on great occasions. 
The blockade—at first a mere semblance—was allowed to grow gradually, and, by great and intelligent effort on the part of the North, became more efficient and real, although never perfect.
Meanwhile, the Confederate administration expended its energies and resources, thus cramped, in a few partially successful attempts at building ironclads at the South, and had an agent in England to buy ships for the purpose of attacking Northern commerce on the seas.
The frigate Merrimac, raised from the water at Norfolk, was by March, 1862, converted into the ironclad ram Virginia, with a draught of twenty-two feet. She was not seaworthy, and was unable to drive the Federal fleet out of the shallow waters of Chesapeake Bay; and when the peninsula was evacuated she had to be burned, on Craney Island, within two months after her completion.
The steam-ram Mississippi, at New Orleans, was not finished when that city fell.
The Louisiana, from defective machinery, was of little account.
The North Carolina and the Raleigh, constructed at Wilmington, went to the bottom at the entrance of the Cape Fear River, without accomplishing anything.
The Palmetto State and the Chicora, at Charleston, had home-made machinery, none having been imported by the government.
This was so inadequate that what was effected with the vessels hardly merits a special mention.
There was— we might say—one exception: the Arkansas, saved from destruction by the forethought of General Beauregard, but whose short and glorious career was due to the intrepidity of her commander, his officers and crew, and not to her own strength and capacity.
None of these Confederate vessels or ironclads were, in the strict sense of the word, seaworthy, and, beyond river and harbor defence, none of them could render effectual service.
The agent of the Confederate government in Europe for the obtainment of ships was Captain J. D. Bullock.
How late he went is not known.
On the 24th of August, 1862, he got the Alabama afloat, under the famous Semmes——not to raise the blockade, but to assail the mercantile marine of the North.
And up to that period the Alabama and the Florida had been the only ships of any consequence secured.
The latter commenced her career from Mobile Harbor, under Captain Maffit.
The Sumter and the Jeff. Davis, two frail, indifferent craft, extemporized for cruising from merchant-ships in Southern ports, had already closed their brief careers.
The Nashville, a coasting steamer, made a voyage across the ocean in 1863, under Captain Pegram, and was run ashore on the coast of Georgia, to save her from capture.
In 1864 the Shenandoah was bought in England, and placed under command of Captain Waddell; the Georgia, under Captain Maury.
The Tallahassee and the Chickamauga—blockade-running screw-propellers had run into Wilmington—were also bought, and sent out with the Confederate flag, under Captains Wood and Wilkinson respectively, in 1864.
What was done by the Confederate government to raise the blockade, on the one hand, and to sweep the commerce of the North from the ocean, on the other, was accomplished, almost exclusively, by the few ships mentioned.
Such were the tardy and feeble efforts made, which show the extent of the failure to procure a navy.
Meanwhile, we had naval officers of superior ability—one admiral, twelve captains, thirty commanders, and one hundred and twelve lieutenants—all ready and anxious for service.
The principal officers had belonged to the navy of the United States common to both sections before the war, and among them were men of world-wide renown. 
3. In regard to the financial operations of the Confederate government, it was believed by many that Treasury notes, payable for all public debts, except duties, could be used to the amount of from $100,000,000 to, possibly, $200,000,000. But, beyond that limit, it was unquestionable that such issues must exceed the necessities of business and bring about want of confidence, speculation, and depreciation.
At best Treasury notes were simply a form of credit, based upon income or funds derivable from certain sources.
And it was obvious that for the actual means of carrying on the government and meeting the requirements of a  great war we were necessarily dependent upon three resources: duties on imports and on exports; direct taxation; and the sale of bonds for money, or for cotton, which, in the markets of the world, commanded gold. 
With a blockade interfering to prevent imports and exports it was plain that duties would yield but little revenue; and so long as such a state of things continued to exist that source must be of small avail. 
With a blockade the marketing of the staple products of the country was also interrupted; and when, besides this, our people were urged to plant less cotton and to grow food crops, it was manifest that direct taxation would prove, not; merely onerous, but, in the emergencies of the government, utterly inadequate. 
The practical resource of the Confederacy, therefore, consisted in the sale of bonds, payable in ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years. 
The people of the South were earnest and patriotic in their efforts permanently to establish their government; and, so far as they had means available for investment in bonds, they were willing to invest their money and their cotton.
Their private resources were far ampler than those of their ancestors in 1776 and in 1812, when the blockade was complete; and they were able to make such investments to sustain the government.
But, for the pressing exigencies of a great war, it was evident that the Confederate government must obtain means through large loans on time from bankers abroad, as is commonly done. 
The sale of bonds abroad depended on the security offered.
The Confederate government, newly set up, was involved in a struggle of vast proportions.
Capitalists are proverbially cautious, and it could not be expected that the moneyed men of Europe would lend the large amounts needed upon the bare stake of the success of the Confederate States in achieving independence.
But the people of the South raised cotton in large amounts, which, in the markets of the world, was equivalent to specie, and there was a general willingness to transfer a large portion of it to the Confederate government in exchange for bonds bearing 8 per cent. interest, and payable at a distant day. With this cotton, from the crops of 1860, 1861, and 1862, to sell or to pledge in Europe, funds necessary to carry on the war effectively, and to keep up the credit of the country, could have been obtained.
And, using cotton as a tangible collateral security,  the Confederate government might have arranged to get the benefit of an advance of price. 
It should not be forgotten that, in the summer of 1862, the British consul at Charleston, Mr. Bunch, made this official statement concerning the efficiency of the blockade: Authoritative accounts and commercial letters, submitted to me by my government, prove that any vessel in Europe destined for a Southern port could be insured, with her cargo, at a premium of 7, 10, 15 per cent. And to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, the practicability of this policy and the financial failure of the administration, a single additional fact may be cited.
As late as March, 1863, when the Treasury notes of the Confederate government were worth but twenty-five cents on the dollar, a loan of $15,000,000 was asked on Confederate bonds, secured by cotton, to be delivered at Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, or New Orleans, or within ten miles of a railroad or stream navigable to the ocean.
The applications in London and in Paris to take the loan exceeded $75,000,000; and it stood in the London market at 5 per cent. premium.
For this fact Mr. Davis is our authority. 
The United States, during the war, had no such substantial basis on which to issue currency or to negotiate loans on time bonds.
Their credit rested solely on their progress and prospective success in reducing the South by force of arms.
And the helplessness manifested by the Confederate administration in utilizing its superior advantages in financial position gave strength and potency to the efforts of the Northern government, which borrowed, from time to time, all that it required. 
That the Confederate government should purchase, With its bonds, the cotton in the South, and ship it or pledge its delivery, as above suggested, was proposed and pressed in the early days of its organization.
But the policy was neither appreciated nor acted upon. 
The customs collected up to August 1st, 1862, amounted to only $1,437,400. And the people had been harassed by a direct tax, from which, to that date, only $10,539,910.70 had been realized; $15,000,000 were raised on bonds, secured by a duty on the exportation of cotton of one-eighth of a cent per pound; and $22,613,346.61 were raised on 8.20 bonds.
A resort to the issue of Treasury notes and call certificates to the amount  of $248,106,116.61 covers nearly all the financial operations effected up to the date mentioned. 
The permanent constitution of the Confederate States went into effect on the 22d of February, 1862; and in this constitution it was provided that Congress should appropriate no money from the Treasury except by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses, taken by yeas and nays, unless it were asked and estimated for by some one of the heads of departments, and submitted to Congress by the President.
Therefore, unless the Executive asked for appropriations for any purpose, it was hardly possible to pass them, and, if passed, they were subject to the President's veto.
So that the administration, and not Congress, was chiefly responsible for the financial operations. 
By December, 1863, the currency put out by the Confederate government amounted to over $600,000,000, or much more than threefold the sum required by the business of the country. 
The scale of depreciation was as follows:

The administration relied mainly on the issue of Treasury notes and call certificates, which it could not redeem, and then on the  compulsory funding of these in bonds.
The result of this financiering was constant embarrassment, followed by a steady decline of credit.
Only $11,000,000 were due abroad when the Confederate government went down.
The true resource of the country was neglected, and very little money was obtained in Europe. 
4. The diplomacy of the Confederate administration consisted of arguments as to rights, and appeals to precedent.
The arguments set forth the origin, construction, and federal character of the government of the United States under its Constitution, supplemented by the right claimed by all free people, under the Declaration of Independence, to alter or abolish their forms of government, and to institute such new governments as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
These were expected to justify the secession of the Southern States, and the formation of the new republican government of the Confederate States.
On this presentation of the case appeals were made to the monarchical governments of Europe—not at all in love with republicanism—to recognize the independence of the Confederate States, at whatever cost, as a matter of moral sentiment.
It was further insisted, with confidence, that cotton is king, and that the nations of Europe were dependent on the South, with its annual crops of cotton.
England, especially, with her eight millions of factory hands, could not afford to have our ports closed, and must, of necessity, recognize our separate existence and raise the blockade.
At the same time it was persistently sought to keep the Confederate States commercially independent of all the nations of Europe, and to confer no advantages in trade.
The fact seems to have been wholly lost sight of by the administration that England had large interests in the cotton culture of her East Indian Empire; that the ruin of the Confederate States and the depression of rival cotton production would stimulate and promote British independence of American cotton; and that, unless compensatory and overbalancing interests in trade were tendered, England might seek commercial freedom by noninter-vention. 
The efforts of the Northern States to preserve the Union were not inspired by love of the Southern people.
The value of the Union to them was in the great interests developed through the powers of the general government, exercised by the Northern majority and involving Northern prosperity.
The war was waged  against the South by the North to retain the enormous benefits derivable through discriminating and prohibitory tariffs, exclusive navigation laws, and unequal and profligate appropriations from the common treasury. 
The people of the South had long struggled for ad valorem duties laid for revenue, and against duties discriminating for the benefit of classes at the North.
In 1833 the Union was nearly dissolved on the ground of the unconstitutionality, inequality, and oppression of such taxes.
And, in framing the Confederate constitution, it was carefully provided that no duties or taxes on importations from foreign nations shall be laid to promote or foster any branch of industry, and all duties, imports, and excises shall be uniform throughout the Confederate States.
It should be remembered that, during eighteen months, the question of African slavery was no obstacle to foreign relations.
The United States government had declared, in despatches sent to its ambassadors abroad, that the war was made to save the Union only, and to maintain all the rights and institutions of the States unchanged.
The United States Congress announced to the Confederate States and to the world the same policy.
Thus did the United States government stand before the foreign powers, no less than before the South, as the supporter of African slavery, until September 22d, 1862.
Then, as a war measure to cripple the South and assist the North in keeping the seceded States in the Union, President Lincoln issued his Proclamation of Emancipation.
When this was done the time for the Confederate States to establish friendly relations with foreign nations had passed. 
The fact should not be overlooked that the great Conservative party of England—which, to a considerable extent, represented the land-holding and agricultural interests of the country, formerly led by the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel, and latterly by the Earl of Derby and Mr. Disraeli—sympathized deeply with the conservative attitude of the people of the Confederate States.
Although not in power during the war, the Tory party was strong and vigorous.
It retired from control of the government, Lord Derby and Mr. Disraeli resigning in June, 1859, on account of the question between Austria and Italy, and it came into office again, succeeding the Palmerston-Russell Administration, in June, 1866.
The parties were nearly balanced, and any  blunder on the part of one placed the other in almost immediate power. 
Soon after the government was organized the Confederate Congress unanimously voted the appointment of commissioners, to be sent to Europe to negotiate for a recognition and, in the event of war, possibly, for assistance.
The Constitution ordained that the President shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Congress, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Congress concur; and he shall nominate and, by and with the advice and consent of the Congress, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, etc.
Thus was the treatymaking power vested in the President; and Congress had no authority to instruct the commissioners or to shape their negotiations. 
Statesmen of the South expected that the commissioners would be sent as plenipotentiaries, instructed to propose, as conditions of our recognition and alliance, to England, France, and other nations that the Confederate States, for twenty years, would lay no higher duties on their productions imported than, say, 20 per cent. ad valorem; that for the same period no tonnage duties would be laid on their shipping, entering or leaving our ports, except what should be sufficient to keep in repair our harbors and rivers; that the coast navigation between ports of the Confederate States, during this time, should be free to them, subject only to police regulations; that upon the productions and tonnage of all nations refusing to recognize our independence there should be imposed a discriminating duty of, say, 10 per cent. additional; and that, if necessary—but not otherwise—the Confederate States government should make a league, offensive and defensive, with special guarantees—for instance, a guarantee to Great Britain of British America. 
The tender of such treaties would have offered immense advantages to England and to France.
With their great capital, and cheaper and more skilful labor, low duties for twenty years, with a discrimination of 10 per cent. against their competitors for the markets of the Confederate States, would have enabled them to furnish our supplies at enormous profits; and a tariff of 20 per cent. ad valorem would, according to experience, have yielded to our government the largest obtainable revenue, without in any way oppressing our people.
The lucrative carrying trade of the Confederate States on the high seas, and the coasting  trade, hardly less remunerative, would have been chiefly theirs, with less cost to our people. 
Would the Palmerston-Russell ministry have ventured to decline such a proffer of mutual benefits, and to persist in the policy of non-intervention?
If it had, then the subject would have been taken straight into Parliament, with almost a certainty that the Whig ministry would have been speedily voted down, and the Conservative administration of Lord Derby and Mr. Disraeli placed in power.
And there can be little doubt that that administration would promptly have entered into such a treaty.
Even the Whig Foreign Secretary, Lord John Russell, openly expressed the opinion that the dissolution of the American Union would be permanent, and the Confederate States successful.
John Bright, the Quaker Radical, and Richard Cobden, the Independent Liberal of the Manchester School of politics, then supporting the Whig administration, represented manufacturing constituencies, and were noted advocates of free-trade and low duties.
It is more than likely that, in view of such benefits, their prejudices against the South and partialities for the North would have been nullified and overridden by the calls of unmistakable and gigantic interest to the people of England.
The Emperor of the French, Louis Napoleon, was friendly in feeling to the South, and would gladly have joined England in such a programme.
Without such inducements he proposed a mediation in October, 1862. 
Under the action of the Confederate Congress the President appointed commissioners to Europe, with the Hon. William L. Yancey at the head of the commission, to go to England.
But the instructions given him were not such as the past policy and political position occupied by the South naturally suggested; not such as Mr. Yancey expected; not such as the Secretary of State, the Hon. Robert Toombs, advocated; and not such as other leading Southern statesmen deemed of vital importance to the cause.
Instead of seeking to use the power of leaving duties and passing navigation laws, to conciliate the support of foreign nations; instead of using the treaty-making power, which was paramount to the legislative, to obtain the recognition of the independence of the Confederate States, the President gave no authority to the commissioners to make commercial treaties, or to agree to confer special trade or navigation interests.
The commission went without  powers.
It had nothing to propose and, therefore, nothing to treat about.
The administration seemed to have no comprehension of the importance of appealing to the interests of foreign nations for the establishment of our independence.
In addition to abstract disquisition it appeared to rely chiefly on compelling England by her dependence touching the supply of cotton for her manufactories.
If there was really superior sagacity in forecasting the magnitude of the struggle in which the South was involved—which has been claimed, but which plain facts go far to refute—then the only explanation of this unexpected and ultimately fatal policy, on the part of President Davis, appears to have been the entertainment of a design by him to foster manufacturing classes in the Confederate States, and, for that purpose, to hold in the hands of the government the power of discrimination in laying duties on foreign commodities to the utmost extent practicable, and free from committals by treaties.
This idea has support from the course of the administration in regard to the obtainment of arms and munitions of war, and the procurement of a navy. 
When the Confederate commission presented itself in London it was received by the British Minister for Foreign Affairs, and interviews were held between them.
But Mr. Yancey, as we have seen, was powerless.
He had nothing to propose or to treat about.
So when the minister of the United States, Mr. C. F. Adams, on the 12th of June, 1861, expressed the great dissatisfaction of his government, coupled with a threat to retaliate, if such interviews continued, the British Minister, having ascertained that it was the policy of the Confederate government to use the commercial dependence of England to obtain compulsory recognition, and to make no treaties conferring advantages in trade or commerce, cut short further official intercourse.
Not until November, 1861, were Messrs. Mason, Slidell, Mann, and Rost sent over to Europe.
And they, too, had only arguments to offer concerning legal rights and precedents unacceptable to monarchies; and they accomplished nothing.
Our attempts at diplomacy were an egregious failure.
In the language of the Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, in the Confederate Senate, from 1862 to 1865 —the Hon. James L. Orr—the Confederate States had no diplomacy.
In defending the territory, population, and supply resources of  the Southern States the success or failure of the Confederate administration may be judged by a brief presentment of cardinal points.
By the devoted courage and unsurpassed endurance of our volunteers, accepted in insufficient numbers, ill-fed, ill-clothed, and ill-armed, but led by officers of ability, brilliant victories had been achieved over the invading forces of the North; and drawn battles, hardly less distinguished, had been fought against heavy odds.
But, although the armies of the United States had received terrible repulses on various occasions, they certainly made considerable progress in occupying important portions and positions of the Confederacy.
In 1861 were fought the battles of Bethel, June 10th; Manassas, July 21st; Ball's Bluff, October 21st—in Virginia; and in Missouri the battles of Springfield, August 10th; Lexington, September 21st; Belmont, November 7th.
In 1862 the battle of Seven Pines, May 31st; Port Republic, June 8th; the seven days battles near Richmond, at the end of June; Cedar Run, July 19th; second Manassas, July 29th, 30th, 31st—in Virginia; followed by Boonsboroa and Sharpsburg, on the 14th and 17th of September.
In the West there were fought the battle of Elkhorn, in Arkansas, March 5th; Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, Tennessee, on the 5th and 16th of February; and Shiloh, in North Mississippi, on the 6th and 7th of April.
The Confederate States lost the harbor of Port Royal, South Carolina, November 7th, 1861; Norfolk, with its Navy Yard, May, 1862; and also Pensacola—these constituting the finest ports on the Southern coast.
Of the cities, St. Louis and Louisville were lost in 1861; Nashville, in February, 1862; New Orleans, in April; Galveston, in May; Memphis, in June.
Besides these, the Mississippi River was lost, and also the three States of Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee, whose young men, generally, were with the Confederacy in feeling, and—if they had had encouragement and timely assistance—would have recruited the Southern armies with thousands of brave soldiers.
These states were all the more important on account of their large production of grain crops, meat, horses, and mules; and their loss was a series of severe blows to the Confederacy.
The prime causes of these disasters may be noted in what has heretofore been pointed out. 
It is notable that before September, 1862, public opinion concerning the management of Confederate affairs had undergone a decided change, and that grave doubts respecting the competency  of the Executive to guide the destinies of the South were entertained by many who had the opportunity of knowing what was done and what was omitted. 
Fearing the result of such a feeling, Congress—which, upon the formation of the government, had never resorted to secret sessions except on very important occasions—began to transact no small amount of its business with closed doors; and secret sessions, heretofore the exception, now became almost the prevailing rule.
There doubtless were circumstances under which it was eminently right to keep the North from knowing what took place in the legislative halls of the South.
In war secrecy is often an element of success.
But on many other occasions, and when there was no necessity to conceal anything from our enemies, the people of the Confederate States were kept in ignorance of their own affairs, and of the views and opinions of their representatives.
Thus was the formation of public opinion restricted, if not altogether obstructed, and criticism on the conduct of the business of the people, in a degree, suppressed; thus was the power of the government gradually brought into the hands of the President, who was already possessed of enormous patronage, not to speak of the veto power.
The people were cut off from the opportunity of finding a remedy for errors, no matter how gross and vital they might be. But there were results so patent that they could not be withheld from sight; and in some of these the public could not help perceiving a mismanagement which could only lead to disaster. 
In the war of 1812 with England, and in the Mexican war of 1846, the general government called upon the states for troops needed in addition to the regular army; and the state authorities organized, officered, and sent forth their respective quotas.
During the late war the Federal government again called upon the governors of the states for the soldiers required, and received them, officered, at their hands.
But the President of the Confederate States, after declining to accept the services of thousands upon thousands of volunteers tendered, and after opposing bills offered in Congress, in January, 1862, authorizing him to call for troops from the states, to the number of fifty thousand and upward, as late as March, 1862, drove Congress, on the plea of necessity, to pass an act of conscription, which set aside the authority of the states, and gave the Executive power to conscribe the peopie  and appoint the officers.
This arbitrary and unwarranted step, taken without the least foresight or sagacity—wholly unnecessary and unpopular—did not strengthen the administration or the cause with the people of the South.
To this was afterwards added unjust impressments of private property for the use of the government—makeshifts odious to a free people, and resorted to, in a great measure, to assist the notorious incompetency of many appointees of the administration—most conspicuous among whom was the well-known and proverbially inefficient CommissaryGen-eral of the Confederate States. 
As events rolled on, foreshadowing the inevitable effects of persistently recurring causes, anxiety and distrust of the Confederate government, which the Executive head had all but absorbed and jealously controlled, pervaded the minds of all intelligent men who were informed and were not blinded by partiality or warped by personal interest.
And the dreaded result at last came.
The weight of numbers—though not that weight alone; the prestige of reputed constituted Federal authority abroad—though not that prestige alone; but, concurring with these, want of sagacity, inefficiency, improvidence, and narrow-mindedness on the part of the administration; egotism and illiberality; culpable loss of time and of opportunity—these, altogether and combined, brought on the annihilation of the hope of Southern independence. 
At the close of hostilities between the two contending sections the picture was a dark one.
Civil strife, whatever be its cause, whatever its purpose, carries with it ruin, and is followed by cruel remembrances.
During nearly six years after the furling of the Confederate battle-flag there was added to the mortification of defeat for the South the disheartening reality of humiliation and distinctive oppression.
Power and the sense of victory achieved are not always accompanied by conciliation, justice, and generosity.
Yet the South was earnest in laying down her arms, and accepted the result of the war with a brave and honest spirit.
Time, the great soother of all human woes, has begun and is advancing with its work of pacification and obliteration.
It is now a fact that the Southern States are as faithful supporters of Federal government as any of the Northern States of the Union. 
Notwithstanding the cloud that has darkened its political horizon, a great future lies before the whole American republic.
Gradually emerging from her ruin, and without slavery, the South  possesses her peculiar agricultural advantages, and is becoming both manufacturing and commercial in character.
In the days of renewed prosperity to come this book may aid in recalling to mind and to honor the patriot soldiers and the statesmen who made every sacrifice in what they conscientiously believed to be the defence of constitutional liberty.
Among these will be numbered General G. T. Beauregard.

  Richmond, Sept. 10th, 1862.  
To Genl. Beauregard: 
Special Orders, No. 22, dated August 29th, assign you to the command of the Department of South Carolina and Georgia—headquarters, Charleston.
It was, through inadvertence, mailed to your address at Bladon Springs.  S.  Cooper, A. and I. Genl.

Please forward there copies of orders and instructions.
None received yet from Bladon.  G. T.  Beauregard.     
  61 Broadway, N. Y., July 22d, 1882.  
Dear General,—I am unable at this time to answer your note of 18th instant more specially than to state that when I was Chief of the Staff of your forces, charged with the defence of the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, from the autumn of 1862 to the spring of 1864, I discovered in the archives of my office a document left behind by Major-General Pemberton, whom you immediately succeeded in command in that quarter, in October, 1862, which embraced a recommendation from that officer of the abandonment, as untenable, of the whole outer or immediate coast-line of defences.
Upon this point my recollection is distinct.
The exact details of the system of defence which General Pemberton recommended to be substituted for the one abandoned I cannot venture to give from memory.
It remains to be said that the document referred to bore an adverse endorsement from the hand of Mr. Davis, so far at least as any immediate execution of the proposed plan was concerned; and, as well as I recollect, a further endorsement of like character on the part of General Lee.
The dates of these papers I do not recollect. 
Yours, very truly,  Thomas  Jordan.     
  Adjutant and Inspector-General's Office, Richmond, Va., Sept. 17th, 1862.  
Special Orders, No. 128:

Special Orders, No. 178: 
I. Major-General J. C. Pemberton is relieved from duty in this Department, and will proceed to obey paragraph XVI., Special Orders, No. 128, Adjutant and Inspector-General's Office, Richmond, Va., September 17th, 1862. * * * 
By command of Genl. Beauregard.
Thomas Jordan, Chief of Staff.    
  Charleston, S. C., Sept. 23d, 1862. Genl. Pemberton:  
In view of your exact knowledge of the requirements of the Department, I have to request that you will furnish me, before leaving, with an estimate of the minimum forces, of all arms, which you may regard as essential for a successful defence of-first, Charleston and its dependencies; second, the District of South Carolina; third, Savannah and its dependencies; fourth, the District of Georgia. 
You will also oblige me by having prepared a statement showing the present location of all the troops of different arms in the whole Department. 
Respectfully, General, your obdt.
servt.,  G. T.  Beauregard.    
General Beauregard's Inspection of the Defences of Charleston and Savannah.  
  Charleston, S. C., Sept. 24th, 1862.  
September 16th.—I inspected, with General Commanding Pemberton and Brigadier-General Jordan, my Chief of Staff, and Colonels Gonzales, Chief of Artillery, and Lay, C. S. Inspector-General, four new sand-batteries, en barbette, near the west end of Sullivan's Island, bearing on the floating boom which is being laid across the channel to Fort Sumter.
These batteries are not yet finished, and only two 10-inch columbiads are in position, one not being serviceable yet. The magazines are not yet constructed.
The boom is composed of railroad iron, strongly linked together with heavy iron bands, and is protected and buoyed up by pieces of timber of the length of the bars, bound together by iron rings.
The bars are four feet under water, and the whole is anchored every sixth section with an anchor.
About one-fourth of this boom is laid.
It has been tested, I am informed, by running against it a loaded vessel towed by a steamboat, but, it resisted well, parting the tow-line, a two-inch hawser.
I am told it will all be completed in a week or ten days. It is proposed, also, to lay another one about one hundred yards in rear of this one, if sufficient chains and anchors can be had; also a rope obstruction about the same distance in front of the other, the object of which is to entangle the propellers of the enemy's steamers while under the fire of the heavy guns of the fort.
The armament of the four sandbatteries is to consist of seven 10-inch columbiads, one 8-inch columbiad, and two 42-pounder rifled guns.
Fort Sumter has forty-six heavy guns (above 32-pounders), and Fort Moultrie nine heavy guns, bearing at once on these obstructions.
 There will, besides, be two strong gunboats, armed each with four guns, to assist in their defence.
I am informed they will be finished in one month.
They are considered by me perfectly indispensable in the defence of this harbor. 
We thus visited the Neck Battery, on Morris Island, erected to defend the approach to Fort Sumter.
It is not yet entirely completed, requiring about two weeks longer to finish it. Its gorge ought to be entirely closed, to prevent surprise.
A few rifled guns ought also to be put to bear on the main channel. 
On returning I inspected the small work (Fort Ripley) now being built on cribs in the bay, about half-way between Castle Pinckney and Fort Johnson.
It is intended for five heavy guns en barbette, and is nearly ready for its armament.
Its foundation ought to be protected outside to the high-water mark with debris. A series of these small works in shallow water nearer to the entrance of the harbor would be very advantageous. 
I did not visit Castle Pinckney, the armament of which is nine 24-pounders and one 24-pounder, rifled, as I am acquainted already with this work, and consider it nearly worthless, capable of exerting but little influence on the defence of Charleston. 
September 17th.—I inspected this day, with General Pemberton and Colonels Gonzales and Lay, the defensive lines on James Island from the Wappoo to near Secessionville — a distance of about five miles. They consist of a system of forts, redoubts, redans, and cremailleres, not very properly arranged and located, with the exception of Fort Pemberton, on the Stono, and of some of the redoubts.
A simpler system might, I think, have been originally devised, requiring a smaller number of men to defend it. However, the present one ought to answer our purpose, with a proper force of about one and a half men to the running yard of development.
Each redoubt and redan has at least one heavy gun now in position.
The lines between Dill's Creek and the Wappoo are not yet entirely completed, requiring about fifteen days more.
Fort Pemberton is a strong work, and has an armament of twenty guns of various calibres.
There are two batteries on the Ashley River to defend it and the entrance into Dill's Creek and the Wappoo.
For want of guns they are still unprovided with their armament, except the one at Lawton's, which has four guns (32-pounders) of little use. 
September 18th.—I inspected this day, accompanied by the same officers as on the 17th inst., Forts Moultrie and Sumter, which were found to be in fine order and condition, considering the repairs in progress at the latter.
The armament of the first consists of thirty-eight guns of various calibres, from 24-pounders to 8-inch columbiads, and the garrison of about 300 effective men. The armament of the second work consists of seventy-nine guns of various calibres, from 32-pounders to 10-inch columbiads, and seven 10-inch mortars, and the garrison of about 352 effective men. The barracks in the latter work are being reduced in height, to protect them from the enemy's shots.
The small steam-engine for making fresh water is in rather an exposed position.
It ought to be removed to a safer place or be properly protected.
Battery Beauregard, across Sullivan's Island, in advance of Fort Moultrie, to defend the approach from the east, is armed with five guns.
The work at the eastern extremity of the island, to defend the interior approach by water to the rear and west of Long Island, is a redoubt, armed with eight guns—two 32-pounders, the rest small guns. 
I am informed by Major-General Pemberton that all the above works are sufficiently garrisoned.
My conclusion is, that when the above works contemplated for the defence of this harbor, especially the obstructions and gunboats, are completed, and those works are properly armed with the heaviest guns, the enemy's vessels and gunboats will find it very difficult, if not next to impossible, to penetrate far enough to injure or take Charleston.
Until then the city will not be properly protected. 
September 19th.—I inspected this day, with the same officers, the works at Secessionville, which are irregular and but poorly constructed.
A force of about 200 men is still at work upon them, increasing and strengthening them.
The position is naturally a strong one, being surrounded with low marshes and a wide creek, except on one side, where there is a very narrow strip of level ground, along which the Abolitionists made their attack, which amounted to a surprise, and yet they were defeated by one-fifth their number.
I do not, however, see the necessity or advantage of holding in force this advanced position.
A strong picket would be sufficient.
The armament of this work consists of two 8-inch naval guns, one 18-pounder, howitzer, six 32-pounders, one 32-pounder rifle, two 24-pounder rifles, and two 10-inch mortars. 
September 20th.—I left this day at 9.30 A. M. for Savannah, on a tour of inspection, with General Pemberton and Colonel Gonzales.
Stopped at Rantowle's Station to inspect works there.
An open battery, with four guns (two 24pound-ers and two 12-pounders), a strong and good position, commanding roads from Savannah and Church Flats, on Stono, three miles off, where there is also a battery of three guns (two 32-pounders and one rifled 12-pounder) to command an obstruction and prevent a landing from John's Island and the passage by water up Church Flats, in which case troops at Adams's Run, nine or ten miles off—a central and healthy point—would have to support that battery or fall back on the one at Rantowle's. The right flank of the latter should be extended, or a detached redan constructed towards the prairie or marshes in the direction of Wallace's, where there is also a battery of two guns (one 32-pounder and one rifled 6-pounder), occupying a strong, isolated position, to flank battery at the station, and two bridges across Rantowle's Creek—a branch of the Stono—below Church Flats.
This river must be examined from the latter point to the Wappoo Cut, to determine if there are any landing-places by which the works at the overflow could be turned.
There are two enclosed field works——miles from Charleston, commanding the road from Savannah to the long or new bridge across the Ashley.
They appear to be well located, provided they cannot be turned on the right or left towards the Wappoo, which must be inquired into, if they are manned. 
September 21st.—I inspected this day the defences of Savannah, with the same officers, and General Mercer commanding.
They are not yet completed, but are progressing rapidly.
Those on the river, I am informed, are finished, Fort Boggs excepted which has, however, its armament—sixteen guns—in position.
The  line of lunettes and redans around the city are about half finished, I should judge.
These works are rather too close to each other, and unnecessarily strong in profile.
There are about 1400 men (negroes) at work upon them.
The obstructions—piling and cribwork filled in with stones and bricks—about one mile below Fort Jackson and its batteries, are nearly completed, requiring about ten or fifteen days longer to finish them.
They will then obstruct very thoroughly, I think, the navigation of the river.
They will, however, require to be watched and repaired constantly, owing to the effect of the current on the bottom between the cribs. 
The outer line of defences, consisting of detached works or batteries, at Thunderbolt and other points, armed with heavy guns, were not visited for want of time, but I am informed by General Pemberton that they are completed, well armed, and, with a proper garrison, could not be taken by the enemy, if well defended.
By their advantageous position they cannot be turned.
He places great reliance on them.
An additional work at Coffee Bluff, on the Ogeechee, to be constructed, in the opinion of the Chief-Engineer of the Georgia District, Captain McCready.
This must be looked into. 
Upon the whole, I consider Savannah thoroughly defended from a naval attack, and when its line of land defences will be completed, with a proper garrison of about 15,000 men, may be considered impregnable until the enemy shall bring against it an overwhelming force, which it is not probable they will ever attempt, as the result, if favorable, will not compensate them for the expense and trouble. 
September 24th.—I inspected this day, with Colonel Gonzales, the line of works on the Neck to defend the city of Charleston from land attack from the north.
It is a continuous bastion line of strong profile and elaborately constructed, but badly located, I believe, not being well adapted to the ground.
It is commanded to a certain extent by woods in front, and can be enfiladed and taken in reverse by gunboats on the Cooper and Ashley rivers, particularly from the last.
No traverses have been constructed.
They are absolutely required.
Even then this line could hardly be held successfully against a fleet of gunboats in each of said rivers.
The two batteries at the Half-moon Battery are not finished; they are intended for five and three guns each, to command the Cooper River and Town Creek.
The distance to the former is too great.
A much better position could be found, I think, on the opposite side of the river, at Hobcaw Bluffs, but obstructions would also be required.
The profile of the parapet of those batteries is too great, especially of the first one.
Adaptation of means to an end has not always been consulted in the works around this city and Savannah.
Much unnecessary work has been bestowed upon many of them.  G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg.     
  Headquarters, Department S. C. and Ga., Charleston, S. C., Oct. 1st, 1862. Capt. W. H. Echols, Chief-Engineer:  
I am instructed to furnish you with the following extract from a communication, dated 30th ult., from Dr. J. R. Cheves, in charge of outer obstructions:  
In consequence of the great deficiency of iron and the large demand for it in mooring the boom, it is proposed, at the suggestion of his Excellency Governor Pickens, to use granite rocks of three or four tons weight, there being much of this at Columbia, and the transportation of the same being represented to me as quite practicable.
It is the wish of the General Commanding to be informed of your views as to the feasibility, at this time, of getting the granite here and in position. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt.,  Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff.     
  Headquarters, Department S. C. and Ga., Charleston, S. C., Sept. 30th, 1862. Genl. Samuel Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl., Richmond, Va.:  
General,—In view of the probable inefficiency of the boom to prevent a fleet of steamers from passing the works defending the entrance of this harbor, it becomes as urgent as it is indispensable to increase the heavy armament of the works intended to command the archorage in the harbor, and the entrances into the Ashley and Cooper rivers, to the utmost possible extent.
Hence I have the honor to request that I may be furnished, as soon as practicable, in addition to calls for ordnance already made on the Department, with twenty 10-inch columbiads, five banded rifled 42-pounders, and five banded rifled 32-pounders—or, fifteen of the first quality, ten of the second, and five or more of the third.
A greater number of each quality could be advantageously located, if they could be obtained. 
I shall submit within a day or two for the information of the War Department a detailed report, showing the exact defensive condition of this harbor at present, and the extreme necessity for the additional heavy ordnance now called for. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,  G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg.     
  Headquarters, Department S. C. and Ga., Charleston, S. C., Oct. 2d, 1862. Genl. Samuel Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl., C. S. A., Richmond, Va.:  
General,—Should the Ordnance Department be otherwise unable to furnish me with the heavy guns essential for the proper armament of the defensive works in Charleston Harbor, I beg leave to suggest that some of those now in position at Over Bluff, on the Tombigbee River, and at Choctaw Bluff, on the Alabama River, may be prudently removed and sent here, unless they shall be necessary for the immediate defence of Mobile Bay.
They cannot be required in their present positions until those rivers shall have been again swoollen— that is, in the latter part of the coming winter, or early part of the following spring, by which time other guns may be provided in their stead. 
I cannot place before the War Department in too strong language the vital importance to us—if the harbor is to be retained—of increasing the armament of heavy guns to the greatest possible extent, as soon as practicable, in all possible ways. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg.      
 Headquarters, Department S. C. and Ga., Charleston, S. C., Oct. 3d, 1862. Capt. W. H. Echols, Chief-Engineer: 
The Commanding General instructs me to direct as follows: 
You will examine Hobcaw Bluffs, on Cooper River, in vicinity of Mount Pleasant, to determine whether or not it will afford a good position for a battery of five or six guns, to command the channel of the river. 
It must be also ascertained whether that channel can be effectively obstructed with the means and appliances at our disposition.
You will likewise make a thorough examination of both sides of Stono River, from Church Flats to Wappoo Cut, to ascertain whether the enemy can effect a passage of the Stono between those two points to turn the works in that vicinity. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Lake City, Fla., Oct. 2d, 1862. Genl. S. Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl.: 
I am hard-pressed on the St. John's River; 3000 men reported by the commanding officer at St. John's Bluff as having landed at Mayport Mills.
The enemy engaged our batteries, and were repulsed.
Please send me one regiment of infantry as soon as possible.
I asked for a regiment some ten days since, but have not heard from you on the subject. Jos.  Finegan, Brig.-Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters Prov. Forces, Dept. East and Middle Fla., Jacksonville, Fla., Oct. 3d, 1862. Genl. S. Cooper : 
On my arrival on the river last night I found that the post at St. John's Bluff had been evacuated.
The enemy had made a landing some five miles in the rear of the battery, but in what force I am unable to say. As at present advised, I think we had sufficient force to hold the place, and that its abandonment by Lieutenant-Colonel Hopkins, the commanding officer, was a gross military blunder that may require investigation. Jos.  Finegan, Brig.-Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C. and Ga., Charleston, S. C., Oct. 3d, 1862. Governor F. H. Pickens: 
Dear Sir,—To be properly prepared for any emergency it is my opinion that there should be timely, that is, immediate, preparations made at one or more places outside the limits of this city, of buildings and sheds, and of provision depots, for the reception of the women and children in the event of a bombardment. 
As I understand, it is the wish of the people and Government that the city shall be defended to the last extremity; hence I desire to be, in all respects, ready to make its defence equal to that of Saragossa.
To that end I ask your co-operation in providing proper and ample places of refuge for all nontants,  when it shall be necessary for that class to leave.
Otherwise my embarrassment must be great. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Charleston, S. C., Oct. 3d, 1862. Hon. W. P. Miles, M. C., Richmond, Va.: 
My dear Colonel,—Your favor of the 30th ult. has just been received.
I thank you for your exertions relative to those heavy guns ordered or called for for the new batteries on the west end of Sullivan's Island.
I have lately made another call on the War Department for thirty or more heavy guns (10-inch and rifled 42-pounders and 32-pounders), as urgent and indispensable, having reasons to believe that the boom now being laid might not answer to check the passage of three or four ironclads moving in echelon rapidly against it; hence the necessity of more heavy guns. * * * 
I am endeavoring to introduce gradually my system of managing men and things, and hope, if the enemy will give me time, to be prepared to give him a very warm reception whenever he will come here. 
With kindest regards to all inquiring friends, 
I remain, in haste, yours very truly, G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Richmond, Va., Oct. 3d, 1862. Genl. Beauregard, Charleston, S. C.: 
General Finegan telegraphs from Lake City, Florida, that 3000 Federals are landing at Mayport Mills, at the mouth of the St. John's River.
He has repulsed three naval attacks on the batteries at St. John's Bluff, eighteen or twenty miles from Mayport, but is not strong enough to resist the threatened land attack. 
He says that two regiments of infantry from the coast of Georgia sent to him for a few days will save the St. John's River, and perhaps East Florida.
Send the assistance required as speedily as required.
Answer by telegraph. G. W.  Randolph, Secy. of War. 
 Headquarters, Third Mil. Dist., S. C., McPhersonville, Oct. 3d, 1862. Brig.-Genl. T. Jordan, Asst. Adjt.-Genl. and Chief of Staff, Charleston, S. C.: 
Sir,—I have the honor to enclose a letter written to Major-General Pemberton, on the subject of an increase of force in this district, which is applicable now as then.
In consequence of the evident weakness of the points to which I referred General Pemberton ordered one battalion of sharp-shooters to Grahamville, and one to this post.
He informed me that this was the only reinforcements he could spare. 
Since then my force has been reduced by two pieces of artillery, taken from Hardeeville, and the battalion of sharp-shooters from this post.
The battery of Captain Stephen Elliott consisted of only four effective pieces, all of which I considered necessary at this point.
The seven companies infantry posted at Hardeeville are part of the flank and rear defence of Savannah, and could not with safety be diminished, especially as the companies are much reduced.
When  the enemy makes the attempt to cut the railroad, in my opinion it will be at some point between Grahamville and the bridge over the Combahee River.
It is the line most accessible and farthest removed from succor.
There is reported by my pickets an increase of the force of the enemy on the south side of Coosa River.
On account of the peculiar topography of the country between the Coosawhatchie and Combahee rivers, the cavalry will have to operate on foot to avail themselves of the natural and artificial positions of defence.
There are very few points at which it would be practicable or advisable to operate mounted.
I should have bayonets for a stubborn resistance.
I would inform the General Commanding that I have had a secure boat-bridge built over the Salkahatchie River, five miles north of where the railroad crosses.
This gives me a safe line of retreat and concentration towards Walterborough, should the railroad be taken. 
I judge that the force west of Broad River should serve for the flank defence of Savannah.
I am informed that the only practicable point for crossing the Coosawhatchie River, north of the railroad, is eighteen miles north, at Hickory Hill Post-office.
There is a crossing practicable for cavalry and infantry at the point where the Coosawhatchie and Tulifinny separate, and a crossing lower down practicable for infantry only. 
I will send you in a short time a connected sketch of the lines of defence and the detached works thrown up in this District.
I would observe, however, that these works were made for the occupation of 10,000 men, which was the force assembled in this District during last winter, with artillery in proportion.
The change of the policy of the Government in abandoning the defence of the coast by heavy artillery, and reducing the force to a corps of observation (composed largely of cavalry) rather than defence, renders a large part of these works comparatively useless.
They can be used for retarding the advance of the enemy, but the final stand should be nearer the line of the railroad, to give time for reinforcements to arrive. 
In that connection I need not call your attention to my dependence upon the rapid transmission of troops, in case of an attack in force.
My desire is to inform the General Commanding fully on all matters of interest to the defence of this District.
I shall take pleasure in carrying out any instruction he may think proper to send. 
I respectfully forward the instructions furnished to the commanding officers at Hardeeville. 
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, W. S.  Walker, Col. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C. and Ga., Charleston, S. C., Oct. 3d, 1862. Capt. W. H. Echols, Chief of Engineers, Charleston, S. C.: 
Sir,—You will order Captain F. D. Lee, of the Engineers, to advise with Doctor Cheves as to the best method of modifying the construction of the floating boom, so as to dispense with the railroad-iron bars suspended from the timber floats, and to connect the latter directly with the iron links or chains.
This system of construction to be used as soon as found practicable.
It would be of great advantage to have the wooden sections of the boom to present their side-angle to the force of the current.
You will continue to throw debris around Fort Ripley until its foundations shall be covered about one foot above highwater mark, with a berme of twenty feet along-side of that work; and from thence, with a natural slope to the bottom of the bay. You will have laid a telegraphic wire from the battery on the Stono, near Church Flats, to Rantowle's Station, where an operator will have to be located. 
I am informed that a part of the telegraphic wire can be obtained from James Island, where it is not now in use. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Charleston, S. C., Oct. 3d, 1862. Hon. Geo. W. Randolph, Sec. of War, Richmond, Va.: 
Two regiments ordered to General Finegan will be sent from Georgia, the War Department assuming the responsibility of detaching them at this time from Georgia, where the troops are already prostrated by disease, as General Mercer reports. G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Richmond, Va., Oct. 6th, 1862. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, Charleston, S. C.: 
If you think Savannah endangered by detaching two regiments to General Finegan, you will retain them. 
It is not intended to deprive you of discretion in the matter. G. W.  Randolph, Sec. of War. 
 Charleston, S. C., Oct. 6th, 1862. Genl. H. W. Mercer, Comdg., Savannah, Ga.: 
The two regiments ordered to Florida must be recalled at once.
Answer. 
By command of Genl. Beauregard. Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff.  
Appendix to chapter XXVII.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C. And Ga., Charleston, S. C., Oct. 13th, 1862. Col. W. S. Walker, Comdg. Third Mil. Dist., McPhersonville, S. C.: 
Colonel,—Your letter of the 12th instant has been received, and I am instructed to say that every effort will be made to enable you to hold your position against any effort of the enemy to dislodge you. Nevertheless the Commanding General regards it as but prudent for you to send to the rear all surplus stores and supplies and unnecessary baggage, making at the same time preparations to move back the remainder at a moment's warning.
You will also hold your entire command ready to be concentrated, and act whenever required, provided with three days cooked rations, in haversacks, and two days  provisions in wagons, forty rounds of ammunition in cartridge-boxes, kept untouched except in action, and a reserve supply of sixty rounds in wagon.
As a measure of precaution against waste, let me suggest that it were well to explain to your officers that cooked provisions must not be allowed to become stale, but consumed from day to day, and replaced by freshly-cooked rations. 
The pickets will be charged to use redoubled vigilance.
Spies should be actively employed to procure information, and you are authorized to pay them well.
Reinforcements, if required, will be thrown forward, if practicable—say two thousand from this place, one thousand from General Hagood's command, and two thousand from Savannah—and in this connection the General desires to be informed of the point upon which you think reinforcements should be concentrated. 
It is more than probable that Mitchel's object will be either to cut the Charleston and Savannah Railroad at its most vulnerable point, or a raid to collect cotton and negroes wheresoever most accessible.
He is known to be more fussy than dangerous, and addicted to predatory excursions. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C. and Ga., Charleston, S. C., Oct. 13th, 1862. Genl. Samuel Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl., C. S. A., Richmond, Va.: 
General,—The bearer, Captain F. D. Lee, Provisional Engineer, has submitted to me the plan of a torpedo-ram for the defence of this harbor, which meets my hearty approbation, as offering altogether the most practicable means that I have yet seen of a successful encounter with the formidable ironclad gunboats of the enemy.
This plan having been brought to the notice of the authorities of the State of South Carolina, they, with their characteristic promptness, have placed at my disposition the sum of fifty thousand dollars for the immediate construction of such a ram as Captain Lee proposes. 
Practical builders express the belief that they can build it for the sum appropriated; but as I am aware of the difficulty of estimating with the least accuracy the cost of such work at this juncture, I have concluded to send Captain Lee to submit the details of his plan to the War Department, and if necessary to the Navy Department, with the hope that the co-operation of the Confederate Government may be secured in the construction of the one about to be begun by this State; also that the plan will meet with such favor as to lead to the construction of similar rams for other scenes of operation. 
I cannot doubt that rams properly built, according to the plan of Captain Lee, would be far more effective than gunboats of the present construction, three times as large and costly, with the other important advantage of being built in one-third of the time required for rams of the present models.
Time, indeed, is now of vital importance in preparing for the safety of this city and port; and should the plan which Captain Lee will submit be approved by the Department, and authority be given to use the materials already collected here, I feel assured I can have the work done with such vigor as  to have a ram ready for service in time to render signal aid in holding this port for the Confederate States.
Were some of these rams built at the same time in the Yazoo River, they could dash out and clear the Mississippi River, and aid materially in the recapture of New Orleans.
If elective here, others would be equally efficient at Port Royal, Savannah, and in the James River. 
Let me bespeak for Captain Lee the consideration due to his zeal, intelligence, and capacity as a practical Engineer. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C. and Ga., Charleston, S. C., Oct. 14th, 1862. Brig.-Genl. S. R. Gist, Comdg. First Mil. Dist.: 
General,—I am instructed by the Commanding General to direct you to hold in readiness about 2000 infantry of your command for detached service, at a moment's notice, to which end they will keep three days cooked rations in haversacks, forty rounds of ammunition in cartridge-boxes, and a reserve supply of sixty rounds of ammunition, and two days subsistence, ready for transportation.
These troops will be expected to move in light marching order, unencumbered with unnecessary baggage.
The General Commanding regards it as prudent that the officers should be cautioned not to permit the cooked rations to grow stale; they must be consumed and replaced by fresh provisions from day to day. The service anticipated will be in the Third Military District, and hence the movement will be by rail as far as McPhersonville. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff, Asst. Adjt.-Genl. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C. and Ga., Charleston, S. C., Oct. 14th, 1862. Brig.-Genl. H. W. Mercer, Comdg. Dist. of Ga., Savannah, Ga.: 
General,—There are indications that the Abolition Commander at Port Royal may undertake some raid into the Third Military District.
In view of the possibility of such an event, the Commanding General has arranged to reinforce Colonel Walker sufficiently to repel and punish the attempt, if made.
I am instructed, therefore, to direct you to hold in readiness about two thousand (2000) infantry of your command for detached service, at a moment's notice, to which end they will keep three days cooked rations in haversacks, forty rounds of ammunition in cartridge-boxes, and a reserve supply of sixty (60) rounds of ammunition, and two days subsistence ready for transportation. 
1st.
The General Commanding regards it as prudent that the officers should be cautioned not to permit the cooked rations to grow stale; they must be consumed and replaced by fresh provisions from day to day. 
2d.
These troops will be expected to move in light marching order, unencumbered with unnecessary baggage.

You may therefore leave the money in Young's hands, upon his consenting to receipt for it as the depositary of the Treasury Department. G. W.  Randolph, Secy. of War. 
 Richmond, Oct. 15th, 1862. Genl. G. T. Beauregard: 
The Secretary of the Treasury desires to have the coin turned over to T. S. Metcalf, the Government depositary at Augusta.
You will dispose of it accordingly. George W.  Randolph, Secy. of War. 
 Augusta, Oct. 18th, 1862. Genl. Jordan, Chief of Staff: 
After an unavoidable delay I have turned over the coin to Mr. Metcalf, taking receipt, and await orders. A. G.  Rice, A. D. C. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C. and Ga., Charleston, S. C., Oct. 18th, 1862. Judge Thomas Baltzell, Charleston, S. C.: 
Dear Sir,—I have no hesitation in saying, upon the information communicated to me by you relative to the present condition of the railroads in Florida, that the completion of the one from Thomasville to Bainbridge, on the Flint River (thirty-six miles）, and of the branch from Groversville to the Tallahassee Railroad (sixteen miles), would add greatly to the military facilities for the defence of Middle Florida, by enabling troops from the interior of Georgia, or oriently of Savannah, to be sent rapidly to any point in that part of the State which might be threatened by the enemy. 
I remain, Sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
[Memorandum.] Savannah, Ga., Oct. 20th, 1862. 
I visited this day the defensive works on the river below the city, and the obstructions—the latter are considered complete by the officers in command. 
1. Fort Jackson, three miles below the city and one and a quarter above obstructions, is a very weak work, mounting two 8-inch columbiads, seven 32-pounders, one 18-pounder—10 guns.
Its masonry walls are almost entirely exposed to the enemy's fire, and its flanks and gorges closed by barrack walls boss-holed.
It is entirely under command of a work at Caustine's Bluff, one and one-eighth miles in its rear, and is defective in many respects—moreover, its armament is composed of too light calibre.
I have ordered two traverses in this work, and one of its parapet guns to be put on the covered way, and a useless 18-pounder removed to the lines. 
2. Battery Lee, near and just below Fort Jackson, is a water-battery of three 10-inch mortars, two 10-inch columbiads, three 8-inch columbiads, one  42-pounder, and one 32-pounder—in all, seven guns.
A good position, but its real is entirely open to Caustine's Bluff, about one and a quarter miles off. If the latter were occupied by an enemy with rifled or heavy guns, both of those works could not be held more than one or two hours. The magazines of Battery Lee are worse than useless, being so damp (or wet, rather) that powder cannot keep in them.
This must be remedied forthwith by draining its site thoroughly into the river, by means of ditches, levees, and a flood-gate. 
I then visited Lawton's Battery of seven guns (two 10-inch columbiads, two 8-inch columbiads, one 42-pounder, one 32-pounder, and one 32-pounder, rifled), across the river and a little above Fort Jackson.
It is not entirely completed, but appears to have good traverses between every gun. Its new magazine is not yet constructed; the old one is small, and quite damp. 
I then visited the Naval Battery, on a small island not far from Lawton's Battery.
It has nine guns (seven 32-pounders, two 24-pounders, Blakely); it is unprovided with sufficient traverses, and can be enfiladed from beyond the obstructions.
I have ordered one of its guns to be removed, and a large traverse constructed in its place. 
The magazine is in as bad condition as at Lee's Battery.
The defect will have to be remedied in the same manner.
But the site of all these batteries is so low and marshy that no proper magazine can be constructed without setting beneath the material surface of the ground, unless built on piles.
Instructions to that effect have been given to the Chief District Engineer, Captain McCready. 
On a small island near the city there is a small three-gun battery (three 32-pounders, Hutchinson Island Battery), enfilading the river and Screven's Causeway, on the South Carolina side; it occupies an advantageous position, but apparently low and damp. 
 Savannah, Oct. 21st, 1862. 
I this day visited, with Brigadier-General Mercer, Colonel Gonzales, Chief of Artillery, and Captains Echolls and McCready, Engineers, the line of outworks commencing with Caustine's Bluff, on St. Augustine's Creek, four miles south of  Savannah.
It is an open battery of six guns (two 8-inch calibres, four 32pound-ers), on a position commanding the navigation of the creek, at that point about 300 yards wide.
Vessels drawing sixteen feet of water can navigate it. The distance of Caustine's Bluff Battery from the obstructions in Savannah River is about two miles, and one mile from obstructions in St. Augustine Creek.
This battery is enfiladed by Ostland Island, about 700 yards off, and taken in rear by Whitemarsh Island, about 3300 yards off. 
I have ordered its traverses to be lengthened sufficiently; also door of magazine properly protected; and those islands cleared, to see movements of the enemy. 
There are no guns bearing up the St. Augustine Creek.
This is a defect which must be remedied.
I have ordered a three-gun battery to be constructed at Greenwich Bluff, an advantageous position, about one mile up from Caustine's Bluff.
There is also a three-gun battery on bluff north of Caustine's Bluff, commanding low ground between the latter and Fort Jackson. Caustine's Bluff is a most important position, which, falling into the hands of the enemy, would  completely command the rear of Fort Jackson and Battery Lee at the short rifled gun range of one mile and one-eighth. 
I will here remark that an unfortunate mistake was made in locating the obstructions and defences at Savannah River.
The two are too far apart—one mile and one-eighth—and those defences are entirely under the control of batteries placed by an enemy on bluffs from Fort Boggs to Caustine's Bluff, so that, if any one of the lines of outworks was to fall into his hands, the series of them would necessarily have to be evacuated, and the enemy would then have the way open to establish the batteries already referred to commanding the defences on the river. 
I then visited the battery of twelve guns (two 8-inch columbiads, two 42-pounders, seven 32-pounders, one 24-pounder, rifled, two 8-inch navy guns) at Thunderbolt, on St. Augustine Creek, above Caustine's Bluff, about six miles to the southwest of Savannah.
This is naturally a strong position, with good traverses between the guns, to prevent enfilade fire from Liberty Island, about one and a quarter miles off. Excepting the two extreme guns, which are not yet sufficiently protected, several of these guns are also exposed to rear fire from the Isle of Hope, about two miles off in a southwest direction. 
The front of the battery is exposed to direct fire of Whitemarsh Island, about three-quarters of a mile off in a southeast direction.
The woods on this and Liberty Island have been ordered to be cleared.
Should the enemy put strong and numerous batteries on those three islands, the battery at Thunderbolt might be made untenable.
It is also liable to the objections already referred to, relative to Caustine's Bluff, of being turned, in case any of the other outworks should fall. 
 Savannah, Oct. 22d, 1862. 
I went this day to visit the battery at Beaulieu, of eight guns (two 42pound-ers, five 32-pounders, one 12-pounder, rifled), twelve miles from Savannah, with a fine road leading to it. It is a good position, commanding the Vernon River.
The guns are well protected from enfilade fire by heavy traverses, and the whole battery is in a very fine condition.
The magazines appear to be quite dry. Several of the guns are without elevating-screws, which must be furnished. 
I visited also the Isle of Hope Causeway, connecting the latter island to the main-land, with a very fine road to Savannah, only about eight miles from the latter place.
This is a very important line of communication, and one by which all the outer works can be turned, and the causeway should be commanded by a battery for two guns (siege 24-pounder howitzers, on each side of it); at present only a rifle-pit has been established, with a position for a field-gun. 
 Savannah, Oct. 24th, 1862. 
I visited to-day the battery at Genesis Point, nine miles below the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad, and twenty-five miles from the city.
It commands the Great Ogeechee.
It is armed with seven guns (one 8-inch columbiad, one 42-pounder, and five 32-pounders). This position is a strong one, which, I am informed, cannot be turned or flanked.
The armament is too light; two or more heavy or rifled guns should be sent there immediately.
A row of piles  has been driven across the river at this point.
Vessels drawing thirteen feet of water can reach the important railroad bridge across the Great Ogeechee.
The traverses in this battery are too weak and too low; they must be raised, and the magazine better protected.
The hot-shot furnace is badly located and arranged; it must be reconstructed properly.
There is here besides one light battery of eight pieces. 
From this point I could see Coffee Bluff, on the Little Ogeechee, about twelve miles from Savannah, to which there is a fine and straight shell-road. 
That is an important position which is not fortified, being protected only by one light battery of six guns and one rifled 6-pounder. 
This bluff, however, does not command a branch of the Little Ogeechee (Grove River), which empties into it a short distance below the bluff, but Roseden Island, I am informed, commands both, and should be at once fortified and armed with five or six guns.
Heavy vessels, drawing fifteen feet of water, I am told, can get up to the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad bridge, which is quite a long one.
A row of piles has been driven across the river—one mile and a half below said bridge—but is not protected by any works or guns. 
Grove River is commanded by a light battery of six pieces and one 18-pounder at Stave's Landing, without, however, any parapet to protect the guns; the same is the case at Coffee Bluff. 
 Savannah, Oct. 27th, 1862. 
I passed in review to-day about 4000 men, of troops (infantry, artillery, and cavalry) stationed at and in the vicinity of the city; they looked remarkably well, and moved very steadily. 
 Savannah, Oct. 28th, 1862. 
I visited this day the interior line of defences, which are about two-thirds finished.
The part finished is too strong for the object in view, and the work should have been more equally distributed, for a portion of the most important or exposed part is still unfinished — the part corresponding to the left flank of the lines-i. e., from Fort Mercer to Fort Boggs; the latter work is too elaborately finished where completed. G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Savannah, Ga., Oct. 21st, 1862. Hon. W. Porcher miles, M. C., Richmond, Va.: 
Why should not Governors of Southern States offer to meet those of Northwest States, at Memphis, under flag of truce, to decide on treaty of peace, to be submitted to both Governments?
Has anything been done for Soul?
Offer Mitchell a position on my staff, if he can get a commission. G. T.  Beauregard.  
N. B.—A copy of the first part of the message sent to Governors Brown, Milton, and Pickens. 
 Executive Department, Tallahassee, Oct. 21st, 1862. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, Savannah, Ga.: 
I should be pleased for the Governors of the Southern States to meet those of the Northwestern States at Memphis for the purposes suggested by you. I will be ready at any moment. John  Milton, Gov. of Fla.  
 Columbia, Oct. 22d, 1862. Genl. Beauregard:

 Savannah, Ga., Oct. 22d, 1862. Col. C. T. Colcock, Grahamville, S. C.: 
Make a reconnoissance with disposable force towards Bee's Creek, to ascertain position and movements of the enemy, and, if possible, make a dash at him. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Savannah, Ga., Oct. 22d, 1862. Brig.-Genl. Thomas Jordan, Chief of Staff, Charleston, S. C.: 
Send reinforcements to Pocotaligo or to Salkehatchie Bridge, to report to Colonel Walker; also one operator with the troops. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Charleston, S. C., Oct. 22d, 1862. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, Savannah, Ga.: 
Have ordered the forces here and at Adams's Run (previously directed to be held in readiness) to move, to reinforce Walker at Pocotaligo.
Walker reports enemy in possession of railroad at Coosawhatchie.
Let me know where you are. Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Savannah, Ga., Oct. 22d, 1862. Col. C. T. Colcock, Grahamville, S. C.: 
Troops are being sent to-night to support Colonel Harrison or to cut off retreat of enemy on Bee's Creek; circumstances must decide.
Wait to act with them, but send scouts towards Bee's Creek. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Savannah, Ga., Oct. 22d, 1862. Col. W. S. Walker, Pocotaligo, S. C.: 
Would it not be preferable to send the two additional regiments and one battery with Colcock's cavalry to cut off enemy's retreat at Bee's Creek?
Reinforcements are being sent you from Charleston.
Answer. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Col. W. S. Walker, Pocotaligo, S. C.: 
The two additional regiments and batteries left here before your telegram was received.
They are at your disposal on the road. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Richmond, Oct. 22d, 1862. Genl. G. T. Beauregard: 
Confederate Government has no control over Governors, nor would the latter now be able to effect anything.
We must fight it out. Have not seen Mitchell.
I am trying to get the three (3) months' subsistence you have asked for. Commissary Northrop is unwilling to consent to so much, on ground that he has not enough at other points.
Secretary is willing to give for a month or six weeks. Wm. Porcher  miles.  
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 22d, 1862. Genl. Jordan: 
A column of the enemy are marching up from Mackay's Point; force not yet known. Col. W. S. Walker. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 22d, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
The enemy's gunboats are going up Bee's Creek; they are probably aiming at Coosawhatchie.
Perhaps they will land at Bee's Creek Landing, which they have not reached yet. Col. W. S. Walker, Comdg. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 22d, 1862. Brig.-Genl. Jordan: 
Thirteen of enemy's vessels are off Mackay's Point. Two companies have already landed.
Also landing at Seabrook's Island. W. S.  Walker, Col. Comdg. 
 Charleston, S. C., Oct. 22d, 1862. 
General,—Our line has failed south of Pocotaligo.
The operator at that place supposes the Federals have gained the railroad at Coosawhatchie, and have destroyed our line.
We have connection via Augusta with Savannah and Hardeeville. 
Respectfully, J. W.  Kates. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 22d, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
The enemy have possession of Coosawhatchie.
Hurry on reinforcements. W. S.  Walker. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 22d, 1862. Brig.-Genl. Jordan: 
I have retired to old plantation, one mile from the station.
If compelled I shall fall back to Saltketcher Bridge. W. S.  Walker, Col. Comdg. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 22d, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
I have retired to the junction of the Mackay's Point road and the road between Pocotaligo and Coosawa.
Several of our men killed and wounded.
The force of the enemy engaged is not very heavy.
I do not know what reserves they may have. Col. Walker. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 22d, 1862. Brig.-Genl. Jordan: 
Reinforcements of infantry and artillery from Savannah should be sent at once to Grahamville; those from Charleston to Pocotaligo.
Both points are threatened in force. W. S.  Walker, Col. Comdg. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 22d, 1862. Brig.-Genl. Thomas Jordan: 
When the reinforcements arrive I shall direct one-half to move on enemy's flank.
I am at Old Pocotaligo.
I believe I can hold my position, and that the enemy will be beaten. W. S.  Walker.  
 Charleston, Oct. 22d, 1862. 
General,—A train has just reached Pocotaligo from Adams's Run with reinforcements.
The men are double-quicking to the scene of action.
Fight still progressing at Coosawhatchie. J. W.  Kates. Genl. Jordan, A. A. G. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 22d, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
I have driven the enemy back from Old Pocotaligo.
I shall advance in pursuit of them. W. S.  Walker, Col. Comdg. 
 To Genl. Thomas Jordan: 
General,—This is a copy of a message I just received for General Beauregard at Savannah. 
Very respectfully, David  O'Keefe, Telegraph Operator. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 22d, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
The enemy have been repulsed in their attempts both at Coosawhatchie and Pocotaligo.
They have left their dead and wounded on the field, a number of rifles and knapsacks.
I have sent two companies cavalry in pursuit.
Our loss is comparatively small. W. S.  Walker, Col. Comdg. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 22d, 1862. Genl. Jordan: 
Although the enemy have been defeated at both points and driven to their gunboats, there are indications of a renewed attack to-morrow.
Send me tonight what reinforcements you can. W. S.  Walker, Col. Comdg. 
 Charleston, Oct. 22d, 1862. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, Comdg.: 
Hagood and Gist will be on the spot with their forces before dawn; troops moving rapidly. Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Grahamville, Oct. 22d, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
I have just heard from Coosawhatchie.
We still hold it. The bridge is safe, and the enemy have retired to their gunboats, which are still in the river.
We have every reason to believe that the Georgia regiments are safe, although we have not heard directly from them.
Do send us all the reinforcements that you can. C. J.  Colcock, Col. Comdg. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 23d, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
The enemy are in full retreat.
I do not wish the two additional regiments. W. S.  Walker. 
Send back the troops ordered to your support as soon as you shall think their presence no longer necessary. G. T. B.  
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 23d, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
After a consultation with Colonel Walker I have directed the Savannah troops to return as soon as transportation can be sent, and the other troops to return to their post, except 46th Georgia Volunteers and 26th Georgia Volunteers, which will remain for a day or two longer.
A reconnoissance discloses seven gunboats still at Mackay's Point, but no traces of the enemy on land. S. R.  Gist, Brig.-Genl. Comdg. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 23d, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
I have arrived here with two strong regiments.
No indications of any attack.
Colonel Walker reports that they have retreated.
I will scout and find out. No more troops wanted. S. R.  Gist.  
Consult with Colonel Walker when to return to Charleston. 
G. T. B. 
Telegram from Savannah, Oct. 23d, 1862.—Received same day at Richmond. Genl. S. Cooper: 
The Abolitionists attacked in force Pocotaligo and Coosawhatchie yesterday; they were gallantly repulsed to their gunboats at Mackay's Point and Bee's Creek Landing, by Colonel W. S. Walker, commanding troops sent from here.
Enemy had come in thirteen transports and gunboats.
Charleston Railroad is uninjured.
Abolitionists left their dead and wounded on the field.
Our cavalry in hot pursuit. G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 24th, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
The enemy's gunboats have entirely left Mackay's Point.
The emergency which called for the infantry support has passed.
I think, however, that at least two hundred infantry with long-range rifles should be stationed with me. W. S.  Walker, Col. Comdg. 
 Pocotaligo, Oct. 26th, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
General,—Your complimentary telegram was read to the troops on parade, with rousing cheers. Col. W. S. Walker. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C. And Ga., Charleston, S. C., Oct. 31st, 1862. Hon. S. R. Mallory, Sec. of Navy, Richmond, Va.: 
Sir,—On my return yesterday from Savannah I found here your letter of the 20th instant.
I thank you for the prompt and favorable support you have given me, in the desire to construct one of Captain F. D. Lee's marine torpedo-rams, which, I think, is destined erelong to change the system of naval warfare; for it is evident that if ships are constructed invulnerable above water, they must be attacked under it, where most vulnerable.
I confidently believe that with three of these light draught torpedo-rams, and as many  ironclad gunboat-rams, this harbor could be held against any naval force of the enemy, who could never bring here sea-worthy ironclad gunboats or steamers of light draught that could withstand the destructive effects of our harbor rams.
The same means can also be used (with one less of each class) for Savannah and Mobile. 
I wish it understood, however, that I never desired to remove the construction of that torpedo-ram from the competent naval officer in command of this station; all that I desired was, to see it afloat and ready for action as soon as possible.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Pocotaligo, Nov. 29th, 1862. Genl. G. T. Beauregard: 
The following additional fleet is reported as sailed from Fort Pulaski to-day: four steamers, one river steamboat, one large sailing ship, one schooner under way, outward-bound, and ten or fifteen schooners at anchor. W. S.  Walker, Brig.-Genl. 
Appendix to chapter XXVIII.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C. And Ga., Charleston, S. C., Nov. 3d, 1862. Capt. D. N. Ingraham, C. S. N., Comdg. C. S. naval forces, Charleston, S. C. 
Captain,—You will greatly oblige me by furnishing, on the requisitions of Dr. Cheves, three hundred pieces of gunboat plating, from two to three feet long, for use in connection with the boom. 
Let me also suggest that the three ships in the harbor might be arranged with port-holes and quaker-guns or dummies, and anchored near the line of boom, apparently for its defence. 
The dummies were found quite effective in retarding the enemy's movements at Centreville and the Potomac River. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Richmond, Nov. 17th, 1862. Genl. G. T. Beauregard: 
Secretary immediately authorized the casting of the 15-inch gun. Hope to get some more 10-inch soon.
Randolph's resignation is a great loss to us. He took deep interest in your defences. Wm. Porcher  miles. 
 Charleston, S. C., Nov. 29th, 1862. Genl. S. Cooper, Richmond, Va. 
Enemy's ordinary fleet reported to have left Hilton Head, probably for an expedition on coast, or for the North.
If the latter, it indicates Burnside's operations.
Will telegraph further when more is known here. G. T.  Beauregard.  
 Charleston, S. C., Nov. 29th, 1862. Brig.-Genl. W. H. C. Whiting, Wilmington, N. C.: 
Enemy's fleet reported to have left Hilton Head.
Look out for it. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Charleston, S. C., Nov. 29th, 1862. Brig.-Genl. J. Hagood: 
Be on lookout; enemy's fleet has left Hilton Head.
Issue three days provisions to movable troops.
Look to ammunition and haversacks. G. T.  Beauregard.  
[Copy of above sent to General Trapier.] 
 Charleston, S. C., Nov. 29th, 1862. Brig.-Genl. H. W. Mercer, Savannah, Ga.: 
Be on lookout; enemy's fleet has left Hilton Head.
Issue three days provisions to movable troops.
Collect cars to transport one regiment at a time.
Look to ammunition and haversacks. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Charleston, S. C., Nov. 30th, 1862. Brig.-Genl. W. S. Walker, Pocotaligo: 
Please inform me of appearance of enemy's fleet at Hilton Head.
If all be quiet, resume normal condition of troops. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Charleston, S. C., Nov. 30th, 1862. Genl. Samuel Cooper, Richmond, Va.: 
Destination of Hilton Head fleet not yet known.
About ten vessels from here also gone.
Received last night following from Savannah: Four steamers, one river steamboat, one large sailing ship have sailed during the day; ten or fifteen schooners at anchor.
Departure of so many heavy vessels may indicate Wilmington or Mobile. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Dec. 2d, 1862. Major D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, etc.: 
Sir,—You will at once adopt all necessary measures for the immediate excavation of a channel, thirteen feet in depth at high-water, in the Wappoo Cut, for the passage of gunboat-rams from the Ashley to the Stono, in order that they may operate in either river, according to circumstances.
We will thus be enabled to retake and hold possession of Cole's Island, thereby doing away with the necessity of keeping as large a force on James Island as is now required for the protection of this city from an approach of the enemy in that direction.
According to the best information, the whole length of the excavation will be about 1000 by about 2 1/2 feet in width, or 7000 cubic yards in all. 
I desire the whole matter to be done as quietly as possible, in order not to awaken the suspicions of the enemy's gunboats in the Stono.
We may then have the opportunity of taking them, and then of re-opening our inland water communications  with Port Royal; or we may obtain stronger engines for our ironclad gunboats and rams here. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Dec. 2d, 1862. Major J. J. Pope, Chief of Ordnance, etc.: 
Major,—The General Commanding directs that you will send to Colonel Colcock, at Ocean Landing, one 12-pounder rifled gun, one siege-carriage, from White Point Battery, and one 24-pounder bronze field-howitzer (Austrian gun), from the Arsenal, with one hundred rounds of ammunition, and implements, etc., complete for each gun. 
And to General Walker, at Pocotaligo, for the works at Elliott's, one 12-pounder smooth-bore, from under the shed near District Headquarters (when mounted on a siege-carriage), and one 24-pounder bronze field-howitzer (Austrian gun), from Arsenal, with one hundred rounds of ammunition, and implements, etc., for each gun. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, John M.  Otey, A. A. Genl. 
 Charleston, S. C., Dec. 2d, 1862. Genl. S. Cooper, A. and I. G., Richmond, Va.: 
The usual fleet is reported to have returned to Port Royal. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Dec. 7th, 1862. Dr. John Cheves, in charge of boom construction in Charleston Harbor: 
Dear Sir,—The Commanding General, in consequence of the report of the Board made on the 22d ult., instructs me to direct the cessation of all future work on the boom for the obstruction of the entrance into the Harbor of Charleston. 
You will please turn over to Captain Echols, Civil Service Engineers, the material employed or collected for the construction of the boom. 
The Commanding General desires you to continue in charge of the torpedoes being constructed for the entrance of the harbor. 
I am further instructed to convey to you the thanks of the Commanding General for the zeal and indomitable industry displayed by you in the construction of the boom, in the face of so many difficulties and lack of resources. 
Please have all the accounts connected with the boom construction made up as soon as practicable, and report the aggregate of expenditures under the special heads of Materials Purchased, Labor, Miscellaneous. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Dec. 8th, 1862. Major D. B. Harris, Chief of Engineer Department, S. C., Ga., and Fla.: 
Major,—The Commanding General directs that General Raine's submarine batteries shall be located in the following manner, to wit: below Simon Bluff, in the Wadmalow; below Grimball's, in the Dawhee; and in the South Edisto River, opposite Aiken's Mill; or at some other convenient and fit place below the obstructions in the Pon Pon River. 
You will also construct a magazine at Summerville for ordnance stores, to be stored in case of an emergency or necessity. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Dec. 8th, 1862. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., etc.: 
General,—I am instructed by the Commanding General to inform you that Major Harris reports the two redoubts in rear of Fort Pemberton as ready for their armament, to wit: one 24-pounder on siege-carriage, from the cremaillere line, and one 24-pounder in barbette, from Fort Moultrie or Castle Pinckney. 
The General requests that you have them sent to their positions as soon as practicable, without calling on the Ordnance Department, if it can be avoided. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, John P.  O'Brien, Capt., and A. A. G. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Dec. 8th, 1862. Major D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, etc.: 
Major,—The Commanding General wishes the battery at Church Flats to be converted at once into a small enclosed work, to hold two 12-pounder smoothbore guns (now at the Rantowles Battery), an 18-pounder gun, already ordered to it, and two 6-pounder (light) pieces, to be transferred to it and placed in position on the land front. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Charleston, S. C., Dec. 11th, 1862. Capt. Theodore Moreno, Engineer Corps, Columbus, Ga.:

 Wilmington, Dec. 15th, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
General Smith telegraphed me as follows from Goldsboroa: I arrived here about three P. M. Evans is about six miles this side of Kinston, at Falling Creek.
He estimates the enemy at thirty thousand.
It is stated by scouts that the enemy are constantly receiving reinforcements.
Have you anything more definite about Banks's fleet and forces?
Can you come up in the morning without  inconvenience?
Am I at liberty to forward any of your troops to G. W.? He asks me, if I have more, to send them on. W. H.  C.  Whiting. 
 Goldsboroa, Dec. 15th, 1862. Genl. G. T. Beauregard: 
Telegram No. 1.—The telegraph with Evans is cut off. My latest information he was at Falling Creek, six miles this side of Kinston.
Our troops behaved admirably in the engagement of yesterday.
The enemy are now estimated at thirty thousand, and scouts report that reinforcements are constantly arriving from Newbern.
If Banks's forces are uniting with Foster we will need more troops from you. I consider all geographical lines rubbed out, and assure you that if you come over with your troops no one will be more glad to see you than myself. G. W.  Smith, Major-Genl. 
 Richmond, Dec. 16th, 1862. Genl. Beauregard, Charleston, S. C.: 
A telegram from General Smith confirms the visit of the enemy (some five hundred cavalry) to the Mount Olive Station, on the Weldon and Wilmington Railroad.
The burning of a turpentine store there, the cutting of the telegraph wires, and some injury—extent not known—to the railroad track.
There was serious fighting at White Hall Bridge, resulting in the enemy's being driven back with great loss; while ours was not so. 
Reinforcements had not arrived either from here or from you. Cavalry much needed.
Reinforcements from here must have reached him before this hour. Jas. A.  Seddon, Secty. of War. 
 C. S. A., War Department, Richmond, Dec. 18th, 1862. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, Charleston, S. C.:

I have just received the following despatch from Colonel Clinch, commanding south of the Altamaha: The Abolitionists have abandoned St. Simons.
Gunboats all have left for Charleston, which they expect to attack by land.
So says an intelligent negro who has escaped. N. W.  Mercer, Brig.-Genl. Comdg. 
 Richmond, Dec. 25th, 1862. Genl. Beauregard: 
I hear again from L. Heylinger as follows: The British ships-of-war Mel- pomene, Cadmus, and Petrel have been sent to Charleston, to watch proceedings.
I learn again the attack is to be made on Charleston, in Christmas week. Jas. A.  Seddon, Secty. of War. 
 Charleston, S. C., Dec. 28th, 1862. Brig.-Genl. W. H. C. Whiting, Wilmington, N. C.: 
War Department informs me Charleston will be attacked this week; must therefore recall my troops.
After departure of 46th Georgia sent regiment of troops from Savannah; then a Carolina regiment, and so on. Select between 42-pounder and 10-inch columbiad from Richmond, and send other gun here.
Answer. G. T.  Beauregard. 
Appendix to chapter XXIX.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Jan. 3d, 1863. 
To the President of the Northeastern Railroad: 
Dear Sir,—The movements of the enemy may make it of vital importance to the defence, not only of the lines of communication through North Carolina, but the safety of this city and harbor, that a considerable number of troops shall be concentrated by railroad with the utmost possible celerity at threatened points; to which end I am instructed to invoke a preparation for contingencies on the part of the lines hence to Wilmington, which will enable the officers of the roads to work them more effectively than during the movements to and fro of Brigadier-General Gist's command. 
It is believed that by conference and arrangements between the proper officers of the two roads material results may be effected.
Delays occurred from the want of persons (or pilots) to run the engines beyond Florence.
An ample number of pilots should be at once trained or otherwise provided for an emergency. 
There was a deficiency of wood at the stations to meet the increased number of trains per day. Wood should at once be properly accumulated, to obviate the possibility of such a mishap hereafter. 
It may be that troops will be required here from North Carolina, for the enemy, once afloat, may be landed almost at will, and strike at any vulnerable point; therefore the Commanding General feels that he cannot too earnestly call on all railroad officers to exert their utmost energies, at this juncture, to place their several roads in the most efficient condition possible for the transportation of troops with the least delay practicable. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Jan. 7th, 1863. M. L.  Bonham, Governor of the State of S. C., Columbia: 
Dear Sir,—I deem it my duty to acquaint you that the enemy is reported to be assembling in heavy force at Newbern, North Carolina, as is supposed, with  a view to move on both Wilmington and Weldon at the same time.
These operations, if successful, will cut off our communication with Virginia and the seat of Government.
Charleston and Savannah may, however, be the real points of attack; or if not, after the accomplishment of the enemy's purposes, with respect to Wilmington and Weldon, would assuredly become the objects of a most formidable expedition.
Timely preparations, therefore, should be made for such a contingency, and all the available defensive resources of your State should be held in readiness.
Every fighting man in South Carolina and Georgia should be ready to spring to arms to encounter the invader, and these Abolition mercenaries should meet with such a reception as should make them rue forever the day the attempt was made.
From the seaboard to the mountains the alarm should be sounded, to call all men within our borders to be ready to march at the first signal to defend their country and the homes of the dauntless patriots now absent in arms in Virginia and Tennessee.
On that day, it is hoped, under the inspiration of the occasion, there will be found neither laggards nor cowards. 
I shall be pleased to be informed, as soon as convenient, to what extent I may be able to rely on assistance in such an emergency as I have indicated. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Feb. 2d, 1863. Capt. W. J. Hartstein, C. S. N., Charleston: 
Captain,—Please report to Brigadier-General Ripley to take command of the steamer recently captured from the enemy.
Communicate the fact to Captain Lee. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
General Beauregard's endorsement on General Ripley's report of the capture of the steamer Isaac Smith. Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Feb. 6th, 1863. 
On or about the 20th ultimo I ordered General Ripley to have preparations made to surprise the enemy's gunboats in the Stono, by means of boats or barges, with muffled oars.
Shortly after he reported that probably it might be preferable to put eight or ten guns suddenly in position on the west side of the Stono during the night, so as to cut off the gunboats when they came up the river.
This proposition was approved by me, provided the ground afforded cover for such a mode of attack.
He offered to send Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. Yates to make the necessary reconnoissances.
This excellent officer went, and reported favorably on his return.
I then ordered the attack to be made with as many rifled siege-guns and guns from the siege-train as could find cover there from view, properly supported by infantry, guarding the approaches from Edisto with cavalry.
I ordered also three rifled 24-pounder guns to be put in position at or about Grimball's, and two more at or about Battery Island (both positions  situated on the east side of the Stono), to assist in the attack, taking advantage of whatever shelter those localities afforded, the expedition to take place as soon and as secretly as practicable.
I left its details to General Ripley, and well has he, Colonel Yates, and all who took part in it, executed my instructions.
The vessel has been secured, and will be speedily repaired and ready for service as a guard-boat in this harbor.
She is said to be very fast.
Her armament will be much reduced, and the guns taken from her will be most usefully employed here and at Savannah. G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., March 1st, 1863. President of Charleston and Savannah Railroad: 
Sir,—For a successful defence of the line of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad, with the limited number of troops at our disposal, rapid concentration at any threatened point is essential, and to effect this I am instructed by the Commanding General to represent to you the importance of placing at the disposition of General Walker, at Pocotaligo Station, a train of cars capable of carrying a thousand men. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., March 2d, 1863. Brig.-Genl. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., etc.: 
General,—The Commanding General desires to know whether the works on the Stono, in St. Andrew's Parish, are properly garrisoned-or will be-when Clingman's brigade shall have been sent to Savannah? 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., March 4th, 1863. Major H. C. Guerin, Chief of Subsistence: 
Major,—In reply to yours of the 3d inst. I am instructed to inform you that the aggregate, present and absent, of the troops in the State of South Carolina is twenty-five thousand.
Adding fifty per cent for emergencies, and three thousand negroes, you will be enabled to make a proper estimate. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Jno. M.  Otey, A. A. G. 
Report of Major D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, of the gunboat attack on Fort McAllister, Georgia, March 3d, 1863. Savannah, Ga, March 9th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. Thomas Jordan, Chief of Staff: 
General,—In compliance with my instructions Captain (John) McCrady has made a report in detail of the engagement of the enemy with the battery at Genesis Point (Fort McAllister), on the 3d instant, which I have the honor to  hand you herewith.
This interesting report is based chiefly upon information furnished by Assistant-Engineer J. W. McAlpin, to whose admirable conduct on this and previous attacks upon Fort McAllister I respectfully invite the attention of the General Commanding. 
I have visited the battery since the engagement, and found it in good condition in every respect.
It would appear that the ironclads are not such formidable monsters after all, particularly against sand-batteries.
Where crushing effect is desired, as against vessels and brick and other walls, the 15-inch shell and solid shot could be used to advantage; but for the reduction of sandbat-teries the same amount of metal thrown from 8 or 10 inch guns in the same time would, I think, have treble the effect.
The firing of the ironclads was not as accurate as it should have been under the circumstances.
The firing of our battery having been directed against one of them alone, the others ought to have fired with all the deliberation and care requisite to insure accuracy.
I am, therefore, at a loss to account for their wild firing.
The mortars were fired at a distance of at least two and a half miles, without, as usual, any damaging effect upon the battery.
I am fully persuaded the turret No. 1 (Montauk) was injured during the engagement.
The result of this engagement ought to make us feel quite comfortable.
When the grand affair with which the Abolitionists have been so long threatening us shall come off (if it ever does) I am sure our sand-batteries will give a good account of themselves.
Mr. McAlpin thinks the ironclads did not pass over the torpedoes in the river.
I directed an examination to be made, to ascertain if they are in the position in which they were anchored in the stream. 
I have the honor to be, General, yours, very respectfully, D. B.  Harris, Major, and Chief-Engineer. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., March 18th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—In view of the possible contingency of a night reconnoissance by the enemy on Morris or even Sullivan's Island, it is the wish of the General Commanding that you should so dispose your cavalry, for a time at least, that you may be able to place more cavalry to watch the beach, at night especially, of the former island.

 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., March 22d, 1863. Col. Joseph Yates, Comdg., etc., etc., Georgetown: 
Colonel,—Events have induced the Commanding General to change his views, and to direct you to remain in your present command until further orders, and to arrange and carry out the meditated operations against the hostile steamers in Winyaw Bay with Lee's torpedo device.

Major,—The Commanding General wishes the obstructions of Wappoo Cut to be completed as soon as possible. 
He desires you likewise to examine the Battery wall, at White Point, to determine whether it is solid and strong enough to resist such projectiles as the enemy may be provided with, should they push into this harbor. 
Further, inform these Headquarters whether or not the bridge over Rantowles Creek, opposite Bulow's, is in a serviceable condition.
If it is not, the Commanding General desires to have it made so at once.

Major,—The Commanding General, in view of demonstrations of the enemy in this vicinity, threatening operations against this position, by land and sea, is obliged to require the several railroads to hold at your disposition enough cars and locomotives for the rapid transportation to this point of at least 6000 men by the Northeastern Railroad, and say 10,000 by the Savannah and Charleston Railroad.
You will therefore make the necessary arrangements to this end. 
Respectfully, your obdt.

 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., April 8th, 1863. Captain W. F. Nance, A. A.-Genl.: 
Captain,—Hold two hundred men of Colquitt's regiment in readiness to be sent to Fort Sumter, to relieve the garrison until another attack shall appear as imminent. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Confederate States Engineers' Office, Charleston, S. C., April 9th, 1863. Major D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer Department: 
Major,—I have the honor to make the following report of the engagement between Fort Sumter and the enemy's ironclad fleet, on the 7th of April, 1863, at 3 o'clock P. M., lasting two hours and twenty-five minutes. 
The incidents which transpired during the engagement are based upon information received from the officers in charge of the works, but more particularly from the observations of Colonel Rhett, commanding Fort Sumter, and Lieutenant S. C. Boyleston, Adjutant, First Regiment South Carolina Artillery, who made special observations during the whole action; the remainder from personal inspection afterwards. 
Forts Sumter, Moultrie, batteries Bee, Beauregard, Cummings's Point, and Wagner, were engaged.
The fleet consisted of the Ironsides, supposed armament sixteen guns; the Keokuk, two stationary turrets, carrying one gun each; and seven single revolving turreted vessels, carrying (supposed) two guns in each, presumed to be the Montauk, Passaic, Weehauwken, Patalpsco, Nahant, Catskill, and Nantucket, which took position from nine hundred to fifteen hundred yards from Fort Sumter. 
They steamed up main ship-channel towards Fort Moultrie, in line of battle, as follows: four single turrets, Ironsides, three single turrets, and Keokuk, following one after the other at intervals of about three hundred yards; the foremost one moving slowly, and carrying on her prow the devil, or torpedosearcher, a description of which will be sent you. When within twenty-two hundred yards, Fort Moultrie fired the first gun upon her, near buoy No. 3, then distant about fifteen hundred yards from Sumter, which had previously trained her battery of barbette guns upon the buoy, and opened fire by battery, when she reached that position, at three minutes past three o'clock. 
The first turret opened fire at five minutes past three, and moved backward, thus developing their manoeuvre of attack.
At this moment the engagement became general.
The second turret passed the first, fired, moved backward; the first moved forward, passed the second, fired, and backed, then retired from action; the other turrets manoeuvring in the same relative manner, each time nearing or receding a little from the fort, in order not to present a permanent target. 
The Ironsides, when at seventeen hundred yards from Moultrie and two thousand from Sumter, stopped, discharged a battery at the former, when Sumter concentrated a heavy fire upon her; numbers of shot were seen to strike her,  and several to penetrate: three, at least, in her wooden stern.
Deeming two thousand yards too close quarters, she retired out of range, supposed injured, in favor of less prominent and more formidable imps, after an engagement of forty-five minutes. The Keokuk, at five minutes past four, defiantly turning her prow directly towards Sumter, firing from her forward turret gun, the batteries of Sumter, Moultrie, Bee, and Cummings's Point were concentrated upon her, her turrets receiving numbers of well-directed shots; several, apparently penetrating, showed evidence of considerable damage.
When within nine hundred yards she was struck, supposed by a wrought-iron bolt (one hundred and seventeen pounds) from a 7-inch Brooke rifle, en barbette, near her bow, penetrating and ripping up a plating about six feet long, and two and a half wide, which ended her career; she stopped, seemed disabled for a few minutes, then turned to the channel, and proceeded towards the bar at forty-five minutes past four. She sank off the south end of Morris Island, at half-past 8 o'clock, the following morning.
Her smoke-stack and turrets are now visible at low-water.
From her wreck floated ashore a book, a spy-glass, and pieces of furniture bespattered with blood, and small fragments of iron sticking in them. 
The firing of the turrets was timed; they discharged generally at intervals of ten minutes; the engagement lasted two hours and twenty-five minutes. Allowing six of them constantly engaged, they delivered eighty-seven shots; one fired twice, and retired; the Keokuk fired three or four times, and the Ironsides about seventeen—making the total number fired by the enemy about one hundred and ten, which were principally directed at Sumter.
Her walls show the effect of fifty-five missiles—shot, shell, and fragments; the carriage of a 10-inch columbiad on the western face was completely demolished by a shot coming over the parapet; a 42-pounder rifle, on the northeast face, dismounted by breaking a traverse-wheel—both soon remounted in position; four small holes knocked in the roof of the eastern quarters by grazing shots; an 8-inch columbiad burst on the eastern face, throwing the chase and half the reinforce over the parapet, the other half over the quarters in the parade, demolished the carriage, but did no other damage; nearly all the window-panes and some of the sashes in the fort were broken by concussion. 
The accompanying table of effects of shot, and sketches of the elevations of the faces, show the points of impact, the kind of projectile used, so far as could be ascertained by inspection, and found; they were principally 15-inch shell and 11-inch shot.
The nature of the material against which they were projected, crumbling generally without retaining an impression, precludes any positive information as to their exact kind or calibre; only a few were evident.
To the best of my judgment, according to the effect, eight 15-inch shells struck the faces; two of these penetrated the wall of the eastern face just below the embrasures in the second tier, next to the east pass-coupe, not seriously damaging the masonry; one, exploding in the casemate, set fire to some bedding; the other passed through a window and burst in the centre of the fort.
Several exploded in contact with the wall, by which the principal craters appear to have been formed; one passed over the parapet into the quarters on the western side,  exploded, damaging several walls; five 11-inch shot struck the faces, one penetrating near one of the same embrasures pierced by the 15-inch shell, broke through and entered the interior wall of the quarters; only one impression represented any appearance of a rifle projectile.
One 15-inch solid shot, one 15-inch hollow shot, several 15-inch shells and 11-inch shot were found in and around the fort; fragments of 15-inch shells were picked up on the outside; the berme, being very narrow and sloping, prevented any means of ascertaining by the bodies themselves their kind, all being precipitated into the water after striking.
It is reported, also, that several shrapnel were fired over the barbette guns of Sumter.
Some of the shells which exploded in contact with the wall may probably have been percussion rifle-shells, as some of the turrets are known to carry 8-inch rifles; but no fragments were found, nor do any of the officers report indications of rifle projectiles, by sound or otherwise, with but one exception.
The commanding officer of Battery Wagner reports one, by sound, to have passed over, fired by the Ironsides. Nine shots were fired at Moultrie, at distances—of turrets, 1300 yards; of Ironsides, 1700 yards.
An 11-inch shot struck down the flag-staff at thirty-seven minutes past three, passed through the roof of the quarters, penetrated the wall of the ordnance storehouse—about two feet thick—and dropped in the room; another struck the glacis and ricochetted over the fort; a third—a 15-inch shell—burst at the water's edge, a fragment of which was found; the others passed over.
Five shots were fired at Battery Bee, without effect, at a distance of about 2000 yards; one fell behind the breakwater; another passed along the front of the battery and burst; the others passed over.
Six or seven were fired at Battery Beauregard, at a distance of 2000 yards, without effect; two 11-inch shot were found.
Two were fired at Cummings's Point without effect—one, at 1200 or 1300 yards, from the Ironsides; the other, at 1400 to 1500 yards, from a turret.
Four were fired at Battery Wagner; one from the Ironsides sounded like a rifle-shot passing through the air; one grazed the top of the traverse, and another exploded over the battery, sending a fragment into a traverse. 
A single turret, which fired her two guns simultaneously, ceased to fire one of them at about four o'clock, half of the port being closed the remainder of the action; cause not visible.
They were frequently struck upon their decks, and several shot were seen sticking in the hull of one of them; and from another steam issued when struck upon it. A cast-iron bolt (rifle forty-two) struck a bevelled plate or guard around the base of the turret, which curved and turned one end up. 
The projectiles generally broke in pieces, as could be seen by fragments falling in the water, or bounded from the vessel.
One, after striking, was observed to drop and rest at the foot of the turret.
Several of the smoke-stacks were penetrated. 
A lookout appeared on the top of one of the turrets, apparently observing the effect of the shot; at the flash of a battery from Moultrie he instantly disappeared. 
The casualties are slight.
At Sumter five men were wounded by fragments of masonry and wood.
One of the negroes engaged at work at the fort, who  was sitting on the berme of the western face, was wounded by a brick knocked from the parapet and falling upon his head. 
At Moultrie one man was killed by the falling of the flag-staff when shot away. 
At Battery Wagner an ammunition-chest, in the angle of the parapet and traverse, in the chamber of the 32-pounder, exploded from the blast of the gun, killing three men, mortally wounding one, slightly wounding Lieutenant Steadman, in charge of the gun, and three men; blew them about twenty feet, cracked the traverses, threw the shot from the pile of balls in every direction, and slightly damaged the chassis. 
I arrived at Fort Sumter about two o'clock at night, after the engagement, and found Mr. E. J. White, of the Engineer Department, busily engaged building in the casemates, first and second tiers, behind the damaged walls, with sand-bags.
Several of them were completed and considerably strengthened.
This work was continued all night and the next day by the garrison and the fifty negroes who had been employed at the fort, and remained during the engagement.
On the following morning the fleet lay inside the bar, in the same line of battle in which they approached—the first one about two miles and a half from Sumter, and one and a half miles from Morris Island.
Men were visible all day on the turret of one, hammering, evidently repairing her plating.
Wind-sails were set, indicating that their quarters, even at this season of the year, were uncomfortable and badly ventilated.
About noon one of the turrets went south, probably to Port Royal, for repairs or for the security of that place against our ironclads from Savannah. 
The Ironsides has kept up a full head of steam since the engagement, as can be seen by her constantly blowing off. Three holes are distinctly seen in her stern, two just above the water-line. 
The devil floated ashore on Morris Island; the cables by which it was attached to the turret's bow were cut away.
It is probable that the devil, becoming unmanageable, was the cause of the turret retiring early from the action—it being a massive structure, consisting of two layers of white-pine timbers, eighteen inches square, strongly bolted together; a re-entering angle twenty feet deep, to receive the bow of the vessel, fifty feet long, twenty-seven feet wide; a layer of bevelled timbers on the front forming a bow, seven heavy iron plates, through which passed chains directly down and over the sides, through hawser-pipes; to these were attached grappling-irons with double prongs, suspended underneath, at the sides and bow; in the countersinks of the plates were loose iron rollers, apparently to facilitate the drawing of the chains through the holes over them, when the grapplings took hold, to drag up to the devil whatever he may catch with his hooks. 
The colors of the six turrets remaining on the 8th are as follows: First turret, lead-color; stack, lead-color; top of stack, red with black ring.
Second turret and stack, black.
Third turret, black; stack, white; top, green.
Fourth turret, black; stack, black; top stack (1-3), lead-color.
Fifth turret and stack, lead-color.
Sixth turret and stack, black. 
The hull of the turret in running trim stands about two feet above waterlevel,  carrying a whistle, stove-pipe, and stanchions for swinging a small boat on deck, with a light railing around it. When cleared for action she is submerged almost to the water-level—the other articles all removed flush with the deck.
The issue of steam from the deck, several times observed, if not from injury, is probably from the blow-off pipe, taken down flush, as she cannot carry it, as other vessels, on her sides. 
I accompany the report with a sketch of the battle-ground, showing the relative positions of the forts and fleet; one of the faces of the fort, showing parts damaged; one of the Keokuk; one of a turret submerged for action; and one of the devil.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, William H.  Echols, Major Engineers. Official. G. Thomas  Cox, Lieutenant Engineers. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., April 9th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist.: 
General,—It is noticed in a report of Lieutenant W. H. Carlisle, commanding picket-guard, that the enemy can be distinctly observed on Little Folly Island in considerable force—at least eight companies of infantry. * * * 
The Commanding General therefore directs that you give special attention to the east end of Morris Island, to prevent the crossing of the enemy, in small or large numbers, from Folly Island—otherwise Fort Sumter might run great danger from batteries of long-ranged, heavy rifled guns, placed on the northern extremity of Morris Island. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., April 9th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—Indications make it necessary to be prepared for a movement of the enemy from the quarter of Bull's Bay.
You are therefore desired to hold Brigadier-General W. H. F. Walker's command (including batteries), except one regiment, in readiness for movement at a moment's notice to Mount Pleasant, with three days provisions. 
At the same time have Colquitt's regiment held ready, likewise, to move to the same point. 
It is the desire of the Commanding General that this order should be given to the troops in question as soon as possible. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., April 9th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., Charleston: 
General,—The Commanding General directs that you order one of the regiments  of the brigade of Brigadier-General W. H. F. Walker forthwith for duty in Christ Church Parish. 
I have the honor to be, General, very respectfully, your obedt.

Report of the part taken by Fort Moultrie in the action of the 7th of April. Headquarters, Fort Moultrie, S. C., April 13th, 1863. First-Lieutenant W. E. Hane, Adjutant of forces on Sullivan's Island: 
Sir,—I have the honor to submit the following statement of the part taken by this fort in the action with the ironclad fleet of the Abolitionists on the 7th of this month. 
On the 5th the attacking fleet, consisting of eight turreted gunboats and the steam-frigate Ironsides, crossed the bar and took a position about three miles and a half or four miles from this fort.
On the 7th it advanced in the direction of the harbor, one of the turreted boats some distance in advance.
As soon as the leading boat came within range I reported the fact to the Brigadier-General commanding, and received orders from him to commence the action.
Thinking it was the object of the enemy to run by Fort Sumter, I permitted the firing to be rapid at the commencement, using every precaution, however, to encourage deliberation in aiming.
The boats engaged were at all times, during the action, within range of the guns of this fort.
About threequarters of an hour after the first gun was fired the frigate Ironsides steamed up to within sixteen hundred yards and took a position apparently with a view of taking a prominent part in the action.
All the guns that could be brought to bear were trailed upon her and fired, and she in a few minutes afterwards moved out of range.
The fire was generally directed upon the boat in advance, and, I think, with some effect.
Shots were seen to strike frequently, many of them breaking to pieces.
The guns engaged were manned by Companies A, E, F, and G, 1st South Carolina Infantry, commanded respectively by Captains T. A. Huguenin and R. Press Smith, First-Lieutenant Erwin, and Captain B. S. Burnett.
The mortars, by Companies F and K, Captain C. H. Rivers, were fired with creditable accuracy.
Officers and men performed their duties with spirit and celerity.
During the action the flag-staff was cut down by a shot from the enemy, which, in falling, struck Private Lusby, Company F, 1st South Carolina Infantry, causing his death in a few minutes.
This was the only casualty of any importance.
One gunner, Private Harrison, Company G, lost a finger by some inadvertence in running a gun into battery, but returned to his post after getting his wound dressed.
When the flag was struck down Captain W. H. Wigg, A. C. S., promptly placed the regimental flag in a conspicuous place upon a traverse.
Captain W. H. Wardlaw, A. Q. M., and Lieutenant and Adjutant Mitchell King and First-Lieutenant D. G. Calhoun were likewise prompt in placing the battle and garrison flags in conspicuous positions.
Major T. M. Baker, 1st South Carolina Infantry, was wherever his services would be most useful.
The ordnance officer, Second-Lieutenant Thomas Williams, was at his post at the magazine.
Much credit is due to him for the good condition of the gun-carriages and the ordnance stores.
I have already submitted a report of  the amount of ammunition expended.
The guns engaged consisted of nine 8-inch columbiads, five 32-pounder rifled and banded guns, five smooth-bore 32-pounders, and two 10-inch mortars. 
I am, Sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, William  Butler, Col. 1st S. C. Infantry, Comdg. 
Report of Colonel Alfred Rhett of engagement of 7th of April between ironclads and Fort Sumter, etc. Headquarters, First South Carolina Artillery, Fort Sumter, April 13th, 1863. Captain William F. Nance, A. A. G., First Mil. Dist., S. C.: 
Captain,—I have the honor to make the following report: 
The Abolition ironclad fleet, consisting of the frigate New Ironsides and eight monitors, appeared in sight on Sunday morning, April 5th, inst., crossed the bar the same evening, and anchored in the main ship-channel. 
At 2 o'clock P. M., April 7th, inst., the whole ironclad fleet advanced to the attack in the following order, viz.: four monitors were in the advance, led by the Passaic; the Ironsides came next, followed by three other single-turreted monitors; and the Keokuk, a double-turreted monitor, bringing up the rear. 
At thirty minutes past 2 P. M. the long-roll was beaten, and every disposition made for action. 
At fifty-five minutes past 2 P. M. the garrison, regimental, and Palmetto flags were hoisted, and saluted by thirteen guns, the band playing the national airs. 
At 3 o'clock P. M. the action was opened by a shot from Fort Moultrie.
At three minutes past 3 P. M., the leading vessel having approached to within about 1400 yards of the fort, she fired two shots simultaneously—one a 15-inch shrapnel, which burst; both passed over the fort.
The batteries were opened upon her two minutes later, the firing being by battery.
The action now became more general; and the four leading monitors taking position from 1300 to 1400 yards distant, the fire was changed from fire by battery to fire by piece, as being more accurate.
The fire by battery was again resumed as occasion offered.
The Ironsides did not approach nearer than 1700 yards. The whole fire of the batteries engaged was concentrated on the Passaic for thirty minutes, when she withdrew from the engagement, apparently injured.
The other ships, each in turn, received our attention.
The fire of both Fort Moultrie and this fort being now directed against the Ironsides, she immediately withdrew out of effective range.
The other turreted monitors came under our fire in like manner as the preceding, slowly passing in front of the fort in an ellipse, one only, the last, approaching to about 1000 yards. 
At five minutes past 4 P. M. the Keokuk left her consorts and advanced, bow on, gallantly to within 900 yards of our batteries.
She received our undivided attention, and the effect of our fire was soon apparent.
The wrought-iron bolts from a 7-inch Brooke gun were plainly seen to penetrate her turret and hull, and she retired in forty minutes, riddled, and apparently almost disabled. 
At twenty-five minutes past 5 P. M. the whole fleet withdrew.
The ironclads  had been under our fire for two hours and twenty-five minutes. The Keokuk has sunk, one monitor was towed south on the morning of the 8th April, instant, several were apparently injured, and the fact has been demonstrated that ironclads of the monitor class are not invulnerable. * * * 
For the effect of the fire of the enemy upon the fort I would respectfully refer to the report of Engineer. 
One 8-inch columbiad, old pattern, chambered gun, exploded.
This gun was being fired at about one degree elevation, and it is my opinion that its bursting was caused by the shot rolling forward when the gun was run into battery.
In firing at low degrees of elevation and at depression sabot-shot should be used. 
One 42-pounder rifled gun was dismounted by recoil and temporarily disabled.
One 10-inch columbiad was disabled by having the rear transom of its carriage shot away.
Both guns were again ready for action in a few hours. 
The garrison flag received a shot through the union.
The regimental flag was much torn by fragments of shell. 
The garrison, consisting of seven companies 1st South Carolina Artillery, was disposed of as follows, viz.: 
1st. Captain D. G. Fleming, with Company B, seventy-eight men, in command of east parapet battery, assisted by Lieutenants F. D. Bake and Iredell Jones. Lieutenant J. M. Rhett, Company A, although on sick report, was assigned temporarily to Company B. 
2d. Captain F. H. Harleston, with Company D, seventy-four men, in command of northeast parapet battery, assisted by Lieutenants McMillan, King, and W. S. Simkins. 
3d. Captain J. C. King, with Company F, in command of northwest parapet battery, assisted by Lieutenants A. S. Gilliard, John Middleton, and W. H. Johnson. 
4th. Captain J. C. Mitchell, with Company I, seventy-eight men, in command of west parapet battery, assisted by Lieutenant J. S. Bee. 
5th. Captain J. R. Macbeth, with Company E, seventy-seven men, in command of mortar battery and east casemate battery, assisted by Lieutenant J. J. Alston. 
6th. Captain W. H. Peronneau, with Company G, seventy-seven men, in command of northeast casemate battery, assisted by Lieutenant E. S. Ficklin. 
7th. Captain C. W. Parker, with detachment Company C, fifty-five men, and detachment Company E, in command of northwest casemate battery, assisted by Lieutenants G. E. Haymworth and K. Kemper. 
8th. Lieutenant H. Grimball, with regimental band, fifteen men, in command of second tier casemate battery. 
9th. Lieutenant Clarkson, with detachment of twenty-five men of Company B, Charleston Battalion, posted in second tier of casemate as sharp-shooters. 
Lieutenant-Colonel Yates, having reported for duty on the morning of the 7th of April, was assigned to the immediate command of the parapet batteries.
The casemate batteries were under the immediate command of Major Ormsby Blanding. 
The following is the number of guns brought into action: Two 7-inch Brooke guns, four 10-inch columbiads, two 9-inch Dahlgrens, four 8-inch columbiads,  four 8-inch navy-guns, seven banded and rifled 42-pounders, one banded and rifled 32-pounder, thirteen smooth-bore 32-pounders, seven 10-inch sea-coast mortars. 
The following were the officers of the staff: Lieutenant S. C. Boyleston, Adjutant; Captain T. M. Barker, Assistant Quartermaster; Captain S. P. Ravenel, A. C. S.; Reverend N. Aldrich, Chaplain; Sergeant-Major, C. P. Grunshig, and Quartermaster-Sergeant, William Nicoll.
Lieutenant Charles Inglesby was Officer of the Day; Lieutenant J. G. Heyward was Officer of the Guard; Lieutenant E. P. Ravenel was Acting Ordnance Officer, assisted by Lieutenant James B. Heyward, Lieutenant of Ordnance. 
The Medical Department was under charge of Surgeon M. S. Moon, assisted by Assistant-Surgeon Samuel Muller. 
Mr. Edward White was present as Acting Engineer Officer. 
The members of the Signal Corps were: T. P. Lowndes, Arthur Grimball, and Joseph W. Seabrook. 
Several officers of General Ripley's staff were present during the engagement, and, in the absence of General Ripley, tendered their services to me. 
Captain Benjamin Read, Assistant Adjutant-General, Colonel Edward Manigault, and Colonel St. Clair Dearing were present, having tendered their services also. 
Mr. Lacoste also was present and rendered efficient service. * * * 
For expenditure of ammunition I would respectfully refer to enclosed report of Ordnance Officer. 
For a list of casualties I would also refer to enclosed Surgeon's report. 
At 9 o'clock A. M., April 8th, the Keokuk was seen to sink near Morris Island beach, where she now lies. 
Respectfully submitted. Alfred  Rhett, Col. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., April 13th, 1863. Capt. J. R. Tucker, Comdg. Naval Forces afloat, Charleston, S. C.: 
Captain,—Our intention of attacking the enemy's ironclads last night having been disappointed by the departure of the monitors for the south, I beg to propose that we should attempt to destroy the Ironsides, just outside of the bar, and raise the blockade as follows: To-night, or as soon as practicable, to move out with four or five of our harbor steamboats and blockade-runners (burning anthracite coal, to avoid making smoke), and having each in tow four of the spar-torpedo row-boats; these must be followed by the two gunboats, at a proper distance. 
So soon as the first line of steamers shall have arrived close enough to distinguish well (without themselves being seen) the lights of the blockaders, the torpedo-boats must be cast loose—the two first on the left, to attack the first light in that direction, the next two the second light, the third two the third light, etc., towards the right—thus using them as skirmishers in battle.
Immediately after their charge, the two gunboats should follow, making directly at once for the position of the Ironsides, sinking the latter as soon as practicable.
The small boats will make for the nearest point of shore immediately after their attack, and then retire to the protection of the forts.
The two gunboats will remain outside long enough to effectually raise the blockade in such a way that it cannot this time be gainsaid.
They should not, however, remain long enough to be overpowered, by the return of the enemy's monitors. 
With proper precautions in the details of this expedition, I have no doubt, Captain, of its entire success. 
General Ripley, commanding the district, will furnish you all the assistance in his power. 
I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Office of Chief-Engineer, Charleston, S. C., April 23d, 1863. Brig.-Genl. Thomas Jordan, Chief of Staff: 
General,—In compliance with instructions Major Echols has made a report in detail of the engagement, on the 7th instant, of the enemy's ironclad fleet with the forts and batteries commanding the outer harbor of this city, which I have the honor to hand you herewith. 
This report is based upon information derived from the commanding officers of the forts and batteries engaged in the fight, and upon an examination, in company with myself, of those works on the 8th and 9th instant. 
The fire of the enemy was directed chiefly against Fort Sumter, at a distance of from nine to fifteen hundred yards. The injuries to the fort, of which the tables and drawings accompanying Major Echols's report give an accurate description, were not of a character to impair its efficiency.
The crushing effect of the enemy's heavy missiles was less than I had anticipated.
The chief damage was probably caused by the explosion of shells against and in the walls of the fort. 
The manner in which the fort withstood the bombardment is a matter of congratulation, and encourages us to believe that the repairs that have been made, and the measures now in progress to strengthen and protect its walls, will enable the fort to withstand a much more formidable bombardment with like good results. 
Of the other works engaged, none of which attracted much of the enemy's attention, only one—Fort Moultrie—received any damage, and that was very trivial. 
Fort Moultrie, Battery Wagner, and Cummings's Point Battery fired upon the fleet at a distance of from twelve to fifteen hundred yards; Batteries Bee and Beauregard at a distance of from sixteen hundred to two thousand yards—too far, in the case of the latter-named batteries, for useful effect against ironclads. 
Our batteries were admirably served by our skilled artillerists.
Much of the rapidity and accuracy with which our heavy guns were fired was due to the use of Colonel Yates's traverser, with the merits of which the General Commanding has been fully impressed. 
Our batteries discharged about twenty-two hundred shot of all sorts; the enemy's fleet about one hundred and ten, chiefly 15-inch shell and 11-inch solid shot, not less than eighty of which were directed at Fort Sumter.  
The sinking of the Keokuk, and the discomfiture of other ironclads, has established their vulnerability to our heavy projectiles at a range, say, of from nine to twelve hundred yards. 
It appeared on an examination of the wreck of the Keokuk, on the 16th instant, by Lieutenant Boyleston, confirmed in the main by my own observations on the 19th instant, that her turrets, within four and a half feet of their tops, had been pierced by four 10-inch shot and one 7-inch rifle shot, and a wroughtiron Brooke bolt had penetrated seven-eighths of its length and stuck in the plating.
Several severe indentations were also observed, near which the plates were warped and the bolts broken or started.
The top of the smoke-stack (of sheet-iron) was very much torn, and the bottom of it (of similar structure to the turrets) pierced by a 10-inch shot.
The vessel having sunk in thirteen feet of water, prevented an examination of the lower portions of her turrets, or of her hull, which, no doubt, were served in like manner.
From this it would appear that the 10-inch shot are just as effective at the distance, say, of nine hundred yards as the 7-inch Brooke bolts against such structures as the turrets of the Keokuk. 
The result of this engagement is highly gratifying, and increases our confidence in our abilty, with good batteries of suitable guns, to contend successfully with vessels of the monitor class.
The enemy's evident and just dread of torpedoes, as evinced in his preparation for their explosion by the devil, or torpedo-searcher, should induce us to multiply our defences of that character in whatsoever manner they can be made available. 
I have the honor to be, yours, very respectfully, D. B.  Harris, Major, and Chief of Engineers. Official. G. Thomas  Cox, Lieutenant Engineers. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., April 23d, 1863. Capt. J. R. Tucker, Comdg. Naval Forces afloat, Charleston, S. C.: 
Captain,—Your two letters of this date have been received.
I regret much to hear of the condition of the Chicora's boilers, and of the orders detaching from your command the officers and men of the special expedition to return to Richmond, Virginia.
I am most particularly of the opinion that their services may be required here so long as the enemy's six ironclads remain in North Edisto; for they no doubt intend, if not to attack Charleston, to prevent any endeavor being made to raise the Keokuk. Should they cross over the bar for that purpose and remain one night inside, I hope we may then be able to try upon them the efficiency of Lee's spar-torpedoes, in which, I am free to confess, I have the utmost confidence. 
I would respectfully suggest that those officers and men should be retained here until the further wishes of the Navy Department can be obtained. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg.  
General Beauregard's report of the action of 7th of April, 1863. Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., May 24th, 1863. Genl. S. Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl., Richmond, Va.: 
General,—I have the honor to transmit with this the report of Brigadier-General Ripley, commanding the First Military District, South Carolina, of the battle of the 7th ultimo, together with the reports of his subordinate officers, and of Majors D. B. Harris and W. H. Echols, Provisional Engineer Corps. 
The accumulation of the enemy's troops, transports, and ironclad vessels at Port Royal during the months of February and March, and subsequently in the North Edisto and Stono rivers, having convinced me that the long-threatened attack on Charleston was immediately impending, every possible precaution was at once made for the exigency, including the concentration at strategic points in this vicinity of all available troops for the defence of the several land approaches to the position, and provisions for the further and rapid concentration upon this point of forces from other of the military subdivisions of the Department. 
On the 5th of the month the enemy's ironclads, of the monitor class, appeared and anchored off the bar, which they crossed on the following day, accompanied by the ironmailed frigate New Ironsides, bearing the Admiral's pennant.
On the 7th of April, in the afternoon, the enemy moved forward to the attack, in single file—seven single-turreted monitors—to wit: Weehawken, Catskill, Montauk, Nantucket, Passaic, Nahant, and Patapsco, the Keokuk (with two fixed turrets), and the New Ironsides—the Weehawken leading, the New Ironsides fifth in the order of battle.
By 3 o'clock P. M. the head of the line had come within easy range of Forts Sumter and Moultrie, and Batteries Beauregard, Bee, and Cummings's Point and Wagner; a few minutes later the first gun was fired from Fort Moultrie, and soon the engagement became general. 
On our side seventy-six guns of various calibre, including nine mortars and fifteen smooth-bore 32-pounders, were brought to bear on the fleet, which carried thirty-two guns of the heaviest calibre ever used in war, to wit: 15 and 11 inch Dahlgren guns, and 8-inch rifle-pieces.
The Weehawken in advance, provided with a contrivance for catching and exploding torpedoes, was soon compelled to retire before the iron storm it encountered.
The New Ironsides, at the distance of seventeen hundred yards from Fort Sumter, was frequently struck, and was next forced to fall back out of range, evidently injured.
The Keokuk having, meantime, approached to about nine hundred yards of Fort Sumter, was quickly riddled, her guns silenced, and she was withdrawn from the fight vitally crippled.
The remaining monitors, six in number, with twelve guns, maintained their fire until twenty-five minutes after 5 P. M., when they, too, retired out of range of our batteries and came to anchor, four of them hors de combat, and one of them, the Passaic, so disabled as to make it necessary to send her under tow at once to Port Royal. 
On the following morning the full extent of the injury done to the Keokuk was shown, as she sunk at her anchors in the shallow water off Morris Island.  Her armament, two 11-inch Dahlgren guns, two United States flags, two pennants, and three signal-flags, have since been taken from her, and the former are now in position for effective service—substantial trophies of the affair.
The New Ironsides and six monitors remained at anchor within the bar, but out of effective range of any of our works, until the afternoon of the 12th of April— their crews and a corps of mechanics visibly and actively employed repairing damages, and apparently preparing to renew the attack; then weighing anchor they all recrossed the bar, the New Ironsides to resume her position as one of the blockading fleet, and the monitors (four of them in tow) to return to Port Royal.
For the details of this conflict I beg to refer you to the several reports herewith submitted, but it may not be amiss to recapitulate some of the salient results. * * * 
To the professional resources, skill as an artillery officer, intelligent and indefatigable zeal and assiduity of Brigadier-General Ripley, commanding the First Military District, and specially charged with the defence of the harbor, much is due for the completeness of the defence, and the proud results of the 7th of April.
He was ably seconded by his subordinate commanders, whose services he has fitly noticed in his own report.
To Colonel A. J. Gonzales, Chief of Ordnance and Artillery, and Major D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, and Major W. H. Echols, Provisional Engineer Corps, and their several assistants, I return my thanks for valuable services in their respective departments. 
I have also to record my obligations to the Hon. William Porcher Miles, representative in Congress, for constantly exerted services in securing for the defence of Charleston so many of the heaviest guns wielded so effectually. 
The Confederate States ironclad ships Palmetto State and Chicora, under the command of Captain J. R. Tucker, C. S. N., as soon as the enemy advanced to the attack took their positions (previously arranged), ready to perform their part in the conflict at the opportune moment. 
On the day after the combat Flag-officer Lynch, C. S. N., arrived here from North Carolina, with an effective detachment of sailor artillerists, to tender service in any battery.
He was assigned to a most responsible position— Cummings's Point Battery—but was in three days thereafter recalled by the Navy Department. 
The flags and trophies sent herewith were taken from the wreck of the Keokuk, by Lieutenant W. T. Glassell, C. S. N. The more material trophies, two 11-inch Dahlgren pieces, now in battery, were recovered, under the supervision of General Ripley, by the mechanical resources and energy of Mr. Adolphus Lacoste, employe of the district ordnance department, assisted by parties from the garrison of Fort Sumter, under command of Lieutenant S. C. Boyleston and Lieutenants J. M. Rhett and K. Kemper, First South Carolina Artillery. 
The enemy's land-forces, collected in considerable strength on Seabrook Island, and in the transports in North Edisto River, and on Folly, Cole's, and other islands about the mouth of the Stono River inlet, made no attempt to cooper-ate actively with the naval attack. 
In conclusion, I shall avail myself of the occasion to give as my opinion that the best, the easiest way to render Fort Sumter impregnable would be to arm,  conformably to its original plan, both tiers of casemates and the barbette, with the heavest guns, rifled or smooth-bore, that can be made. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
Appendix to chapter XXXI.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., May 4th, 1863. Brig-Genl. Johnson Hagood, Comdg. Second Mil. Dist., Adams's Run: 
General,—The Commanding General directs that you hold your strongest regiment of infantry subject to the orders of Brigadier-General Gist, and in readiness to move for service beyond the limits of the Department.
Another regiment (one of Evans's brigade) has been directed to report to you. 
It is the desire of the Commanding General that the regiment shall be as well equipped and supplied in all respects as possible, before it may leave your command. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., May 10th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. J. Hagood, Comdg. Second Mil. Dist., Adams's Run: 
General,—In consequence of a telegram from the War Department, ordering 5000 additional men to General Pemberton, the Commanding General has found it necessary to countermand his order of the 9th inst., and to recall the troops that were ordered to report to you, with a view to carry out the suggestions contained in your communication of the 8th inst. 
The Commanding General directs, however, that you will retain Preston's battery, and support the naval expedition against the enemy's ironclads in North Edisto, as originally ordered. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., June 1st, 1863. Major H. C. Guerin, Chief of Subsistence: 
Major,—In reply to your communication of 30th May, I am instructed by the Commanding General to say that the number of troops in the State of South Carolina for which estimate of provisions should be made will be 10,000. 
I have the honor to be, Major, 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Clifton H.  Smith, A. A. G.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., June 2d, 1863. Major Hutson Lee, Chief Quartermaster, Charleston: 
Major,—The troops will halt at Green Pond.
Please report when the infantry shall have left the Savannah Railroad Depot. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., June 2d, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Military Dist., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—Please instruct the commanding officer of the infantry force to halt it, and all other troops sent from yours and the Second Military District, at Green Pond; to assume command there, if the senior, and to operate according to the state of affairs developed at this time, until he can receive orders direct from General Walker.
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., June 2d, 1863:8 P. M. Brig.-GenI. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist.: 
General,—In reply to your note—6.10 P. M., of this date—I have to say, that the substance of General Walker's information is merely that the enemy had come up to Combahee Ferry, had burned the pontoon-bridge there, the houses on the river-side, and had landed a party of several hundred at Field's Point, which had made a demonstration, as if destined to advance into the interior. 
As yet I have not felt called upon to make any suggestions to General Hagood.
He has been directed to send Shultz's battery to Green Pond, where General Walker has gone in person. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., June 2d, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist.: 
General,—General Walker says enemy advancing from Field's Point, and suggests that an infantry force and section of artillery should be sent as soon as possible to Ashepoo Bridge.
Of course there are not troops enough available in the Department to hold the line of railroad, if the enemy aim seriously at its possession; but as this may be a mere raid, which may be foiled, it will be but proper to send all disposable infantry from Sullivan's Island, and a section of Preston's or some other battery, without delay-say with ten days rations. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff.  
P. S.—Colonel Gonzales can furnish a section of guns from his field-train.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., June 27th, 1863. Genl. Samuel Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl., etc., etc.: 
General,—Inasmuch as the movements and operations of the enemy on the Mississippi River must render it impossible and unnecessary to send any more heavy guns there for the present, I am induced to renew my application for additional 10-inch columbiads and 7-inch rifled guns of Brooke's pattern that can be supplied by the works in Richmond, for the armament of Fort Sumter, and the works on Sullivan's and Morris islands. 
I am informed that two Brooke 32-pounders, intended for Vicksburg, are lying on the wharf at Mobile.
Could they not be ordered here until required on the Mississippi?
Major-General Hunter has been relieved of the command of the Federal troops in this Department by Brigadier-General Gillmore, the officer who conducted the operations that resulted in the reduction of Fort Pulaski.
I have the orders of both officers on the occasion of the change. 
At present three of the enemy's ironclads are in the North Edisto and two at Hilton Head, leaving one still in Warsaw Sound.
The troops on Folly and other islands about mouth of Stono are under command of Brigadier-General Vogdes, an artillery officer, as you will remember, of the regular service; his command is certainly not less than six regiments.
There is about a brigade of 2000 men on Seabrook Island, North Edisto.
Nothing is positively known of the enemy's land-forces at Hilton Head. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 4th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. A. Gillmore, Comdg. U. S. Forces, Port Royal, S. C.: 
General,—In the interest of humanity it seems to be my duty to address you, with a view to effecting some understanding as to the future conduct of the war in this quarter. 
You are aware, of course, of the fact that on or about the 2d ultimo an expedition set on foot by your predecessor in command, Major-General Hunter, entered the Combahee River, in South Carolina, seized and carried away a large number of negro slaves from several large plantations on that stream.
My present object, however, is not to enter upon a discussion touching that species of pillaging, but to acquaint you formally that more than one of the large plantations thus visited and ravaged were otherwise and further pillaged, and their private dwellings, warehouses, and other buildings wantonly consumed by the torch.
All this, be it observed, rendered necessary by no military exigency; that is, with no possible view to the destruction of that which was being used for military purposes, either of offence or defence, or in near vicinage to batteries or works occupied by your adversary, or which, if left standing, would endanger or in any military way affect the safety of your forces or obstruct your operations, either present or future; and, finally, the owners of which were men not even bearing arms in this war. 
A day or two later another expedition burned about two-thirds of the village  of Bluffton, a summer resort of the planters of the sea-coast of South Carolina, an undefended and indefensible place.
The best houses were selected for destruction, and for the act no possible provocation may be truthfully alleged. 
Later yet—the 11th of June—the village of Darien, in the State of Georgia, was laid waste by your soldiers, and every building in it burned to the ground, except one church and three small houses; there, as at Bluffton, no defence having been made or any act of provocation previously committed, either by the owners of the desolated place, or by the soldiers of the Confederate States, there or in any part of this Department. 
Again, as far back as the last of March, when evacuating Jacksonville, in East Florida, your troops set on fire and destroyed the larger part of that town, including several churches; not, assuredly, to cover their embarkation, but merely as a measure of vindictive and illegitimate hostility. 
You have, of course, the right to seize and hold our towns and district of country, if able to do so—that is, to exercise for the time the privilege of eminent domain, but not to ravage and destroy the houses or other property of the individuals of the country.
The eminent domain and the property of the Government are legitimate objects of conquest, but private property and houses, movable and immovable, are not. You may appropriate the spoils of the battle-field, or the booty of a camp which you have captured, or even in extreme cases, when aggravated by an improper defence, may sack a town or city carried by storm.
But the pillage of the open country and of undefended places has long ago been given up as a usage or legitimate measure of war. At most contributions can be levied upon and collected of the people, and these even, says Vattel, must be moderate, if the general who resorts to then wishes to enjoy an unsullied reputation and escape the reproach of cruelty and inhumanity.
You may, indeed, waste and destroy provisions and forage which you cannot carry away, and which if left would materially assist the operations of your enemy.
But Vattel prescribes that even this must be done with moderation and according to the exigencies of the case.
Those who tear up the vines and cut down the fruit-trees are looked upon as savage barbarians, unless they do it with a view to punish the enemy for some gross violation of the laws of nations. 
You cannot legitimately devastate and destroy by fire or ravage the country of your enemy, except under the stress of stern necessity—that is, as measures of retaliation for a brutal warfare on his part.
If you do so without an absolute necessity, such conduct is reprobated as the result of hatred and fury — a savage and monstrous excess Vattel terms it. 
Ravaging and burning private property are acts of licentiousness unauthorized by the laws of war, and the belligerent who wages war in that manner must justly, says Vattel, be regarded as carrying on war like a furious barbarian.
The pillage and destruction of towns, the devastation of the open country, setting fire to houses, the same publicist expressly declares to be measures no less odious and detestable, when done without absolute necessity.
This, Vattel expressly says, is equally applicable to the operations of a civil war, the parties to which are bound to observe the common laws of war.
Even the Duke of Alva was finally forced to respect these laws of war in his conduct towards the confederates in the Netherlands. 
Wharton is no less explicit than Vattel on all these points.
He declares that private property or land can only be taken in special cases; that is, when captured on the field or in besieged places and towns, or as military contributions levied upon the inhabitants of hostile territory.
(See Law of Nations, p. 395.) 
The pages of the American publicist furnish the most striking condemnation of the acts of your soldiery on the Combahee, and at Jacksonville, Bluffton, and Darien, in connection with the burning by the British of Havre de Grace, in 1813, the devastations of Lord Cochrane on the coast of the Chesapeake Bay, and in relation to some excess of the troops of the United States in Canada. 
The destruction of Havre de Grace was characterized at the time by the Cabinet at Washington as manifestly contrary to usages of civilized warfare.
That village, we are told, was ravaged and burned, to the astonishment of its unarmed inhabitants at seeing that they derived no protection to their property from the laws of war. 
Further, the burning of the village of Newark, in Canada and near Fort George, by the troops of the United States, in 1813, though defended as legitimate by the officers who did it, on the score of military necessity, yet the act was earnestly disavowed and repudiated by the Government of the United States of that day. So, too, was the burning of Long Point, concerning which a military investigation was instituted.
And for the destruction of St. David, by stragglers, the officer who commanded on that occasion was dismissed the service, without trial, for permitting it. (Wharton on the Law of Nations, p. 399.) 
The Government of the United States then, under the inspiration of Southern statesmen, declared that it owed to itself, and to the principles it ever held sacred, to disavow any such wanton, cruel, and unjustifiable warfare, which it further denounced as revolting to humanity and repugnant to the sentiments and usages of the civilized world.
I shall now remark that these violations of long and thoroughly established laws of war may be chiefly attributed to the species of persons employed by your predecessor in command in these expeditions, and should have been anticipated, in view of the lessons of history—that is, negroes, for the most part, either fugitive slaves or who had been carried away from their masters' plantations.
So apparent are the atrocious consequences which have ever resulted from the employment of a merciless servile race as soldiers, that Napoleon, when invading Russia, refused to receive or employ against the Russian Government and army the Russian serfs, who, we are told, were ready on all sides to flock to his standard, if he would enfranchise them.
He was actuated, he declared, by a horror of the inevitable consequences which would result from a servile war. This course one of your authors, Abbott, contrasts to the prejudice of Great Britain, in the war of 1812 with the United States, in the  course of which were employed the tomahawk and the scalping-knife of the savage by some British commanders. 
In conclusion it is my duty to inquire whether the acts which resulted in the burning of the defenceless villages of Darien and Bluffton, and the ravages on the Combahee, are regarded by you as legitimate measures of war, which you will feel authorized to resort to hereafter. 
I enclose two newspaper accounts, copied from the journals of the United States, giving relations of the transactions in question. 
Respectfully, General, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Fort Sumter, Sept. 10th, 1863. 
Extract from Major S. D. Elliott's Journal, as Kept at Post. 
* * * Everything very quiet yesterday and last night. 
A flag of truce from the enemy's fleet received at about 9 o'clock A. M. in reference to the prisoners. 
Another flag was received at 4 o'clock P. M., bringing baggage belonging to the captured officers and conveniences for the wounded. 
A flag was sent from this post to the fleet at about six o'clock, bearing despatches from General Jordan, and the bodies of their dead. 
The prisoners, except the wounded, were sent to the city last night.
The ironclads, four monitors, and twenty-two other vessels inside the bar. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 13th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chf.-Eng., Dept. S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C.: 
Colonel,—In view of the operations of the enemy on Morris Island, and our inability to dislodge him by a coup de main with infantry—with our limited means, and from other obstacles—it has become necessary to throw up a work on Shell Point with the utmost celerity which shall sweep the front of Battery Wagner with at least the fire of one 10-inch columbiad and a Brooke rifled piece.
This work, therefore, you will place under construction, in charge of an energetic officer, with orders to push it forward with all possible despatch.
There must be also provided shelter for an infantry support of two companies, and positions for three 10-inch mortars. 
The columbiad and Brooke gun will be arranged on traversing-carriages, and the work must be carefully protected from enfilade from Morris and Black islands.
Further, the 10-inch columbiad at Fort Johnson must be so arranged as also to command the front face of Battery Wagner. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 13th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., S. C., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—As was determined, in the conference with you this afternoon, in  view of the operations of the enemy on Morris Island, the Chief-Engineer has been instructed to construct at once a battery on Shell Point, James Island, for one 10-inch columbiad and one 6.40-inch Brooke rifled gun, on traversingcar-riage, with provisions for three 10-inch mortars. 
The 10-inch columbiad at Fort Johnson will also be so arranged as to command or sweep the front of Battery Wagner. 
In the same connection the 10-inch columbiad, now in hands of Chief of Ordnance, ready for service, will be added to the armament of Fort Moultrie; and you will also increase the armament by two 10-inch columbiads, to be removed as soon as practicable from Fort Sumter, their places to be supplied by dummies, which Major Hutson Lee has been directed to have made. 
The 10-inch columbiad recently received will be mounted in the Shell Point Battery, when a carriage shall be provided. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 13th, 1863. Lieut.-Colonel Jno. R. Waddy, Chief of Ordnance, Dept. S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C.: 
Colonel,—The 10-inch columbiad already provided with carriage, etc., will be sent to Fort Moultrie, and the one as yet without carriage will be placed in a new work at Shell Point, just ordered to be constructed. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 14th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chf.-Eng., Dept. S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C.: 
Colonel,—Upon reflection it is better not to destroy anything about the Marsh Battery, as we may still complete it, after having finished the Shell Point Battery. 
Instead of constructing those two field batteries near Legare's, for two pieces each, make them large enough for four pieces, to be supported by rifle-pits and four companies of infantry to each battery. 
Afterwards we will construct in that vicinity one or two mortar-batteries against Black Island. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 15th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., S. C., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—The Commanding General directs that General Hagood be instructed to open fire on Black Island without delay, from Secessionville, with as many guns as can be brought to bear on that island.
The 24-pounder rifled  piece at Fort Pemberton will also be sent to the redoubt nearest Secessionville, for the same purpose, as soon as ready for service. 
These orders, it is desired, shall be communicated to General Hagood by telegraph.
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 15th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chf.-Eng. Dept., S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C.: 
Colonel,—The General Commanding directs me to instruct you (as already verbally informed) to alter the two mortar batteries at Fort Johnson into gun batteries for one heavy rifled gun or 10-inch gun in each. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, A. N.  T.  Beauregard, A. D. C. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 15th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chf.-Eng., Dept. S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C.: 
Colonel,—In addition to the works ordered in my communication of yesterday's date, the Commanding General further directs that the gorge-wall of Fort Sumter be strengthened by means of wet cotton-bales, filled in between with wet sand, and kept moist by means of tubes or hose from the upper terreplein. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 15th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Commanding First Mil. Dist., S. C., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—The force on Morris Island, in the opinion of the Commanding General, is larger than is necessary for any military operations now practicable in that quarter—larger than is necessary to defend the works from assault— and so large as to be exposed unnecessarily to the heavy batteries which the enemy may soon open upon us. Therefore you may reduce that force to a command competent simply to hold the works against an attempted coup de main. This command you will please relieve at least once in forty-eight hours by fresh troops. 
The Commanding General finds it necessary that General Clingman shall have a command on James Island—for example, the one held when in the Department before, to with the western lines on James Island—leaving General Hagood to command the eastern, with General Colquitt as second in command.
This is not to interfere with an attack to-night, which will be carried out by General Hagood, as already arranged. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas Jordan, Chief of Staff.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 15th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. Jno. R. Waddy, Chief of Ordnance, Depart. S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C.: 
Colonel,—The Commanding General directs the immediate preparation of the following platforms: say, ten for 32-pounder rifled guns; ten for 42-pounder rifled guns; fifteen for 10-inch columbiads; and carriages and chassis for six 10-inch columbiads.
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 15th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chf.-Eng., Dept. S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C.: 
Colonel,—The General Commanding directs me to instruct you to have Shell Point Battery constructed for three guns, instead of two, as at first contemplated, provided it can be accomplished.
Also to ask that a copy of General Beauregard's letter of yesterday morning be furnished him for his files. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, A. N.  T.  Beauregard, A. D. C. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 15th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Commanding First Mil. Dist., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—The Commanding General suggests that several hundred rice and other casks shall be furnished the troops on Morris Island, for the construction of rat-holes.
It will be well also, he thinks, to send to Savannah, Augusta, Wilmington, etc., for at least one thousand empty casks.
A high lookout should be constructed at or about Fort Johnson, for the purpose of keeping a close watch on the enemy's movements from that point. 
The Commanding General further desires that hulks or other obstructions shall be sunk or established in the creeks west of Morris Island and north of Sullivan's Island, and that a good line of communication must be opened from the latter island to the city, via Christ Church Parish, and across Cooper River. 
The Commanding General further suggests that, in the event of a protracted siege, it may be very difficult to supply the batteries with ammunition, or even procure any from the Arsenal; he therefore desires you to instruct your ordnance officers to make timely arrangements for an ample supply of ammunition, for the possible wants of all the guns of different calibres, in the First Military District. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 15th, 1863. Major H. C. Guerin, Chief of Subsistence, State of S. C., Charleston, S. C.: 
Major,—The Commanding General directs me to say that you will throw  and keep on Sullivan's Island the material part of the rations for 5000 men for thirty days. On James Island, in consequence of the inadequacy of proper store room or shelter, you will place and maintain a supply for, say, 5000 men for fifteen days, with a reserve supply in the city, to be sent there in case of emergency, of the same amount. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 16th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chf.-Engr., Dept. S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C.: 
Colonel,—The Commanding General directs me to say that he wishes the batteries on James Island (about Legare's), bearing on Black Island, to be increased by at least twenty (20) guns, on siege-carriages.
This work should be pushed forward night and day, as indeed at Shell Point and all other works under construction about the harbor, so soon as the force of negro labor may be sufficient. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 16th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., S. C., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—The Commanding General wishes Colonel Rhett, or the commanding officer at Fort Sumter, instructed on the following points, to wit: 
Several guns of that work shall always be kept loaded and carefully trained, at night, on the creeks near Battery Wagner, and Marsh and Shell Point batteries. 
Should events oblige us to abandon Fort Sumter, not one heavy gun must be left in serviceable condition, to be turned against our own works. 
The commanders of Batteries Gregg and Wagner you will please instruct to the same effect, and every proper measure calculated to that end must be provided for an emergency. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 17th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., S. C., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—The Commanding General thinks, as a measure of precaution, to prevent the possibility of the enemy landing at night a force on Sullivan's Island, it would be well to throw there an additional regiment from James Island, where at present so large a force is scarcely required. 
I am further instructed by the Commanding General to suggest that the reliefs at Morris Island might remain three days, instead of forty-eight hours, as previously arranged, the men taking with them the required number of cooked rations. 
He also thinks it advisable to send to-day to Fort Wagner one 8-inch columbiad,  or a 32-pounder rifle, to replace the one exploded; it should be mounted to-night, if practicable, on account of its moral effect on the garrison. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 18th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., S. C., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—It is the wish of the Commanding General, in the event we are obliged to abandon Morris Island, that Brigadier-General Taliaferro shall transfer his headquarters to Sullivan's Island, where, meantime, about the force of a brigade of infantry should be placed, to be employed in the defence of that island, under either Brigadier-General Clingman or Colquitt. 
The subsistence stores on Sullivan's Island, not sheltered by bomb-proofs, should be removed and stored, as far as practicable, out of range from Morris Island. 
All houses on that island which are in the way you will please have torn down, using the material for any defensive purposes which may be found practicable, especially shelters against fire of the enemy for the infantry supports.
Please give your attention to all practicable means of securing the deliverance, in extremity, of all the force from Morris Island, to which end boats, barges, and flats should be collected and kept in serviceable condition, at or near Fort Johnson. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 20th, 1863. Hon. James A. Seddon, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.: 
Sir,—Your letter of the 12th inst. was handed to me some days ago, but my incessant occupation with the current duties of my position at such a juncture has not allowed me time for the preparation of such an answer as would give the Department any very clear knowledge of the details of the occurrences on Morris Island. 
A full report will be made as soon as subordinate officers shall have placed these Headquarters in official possession of the facts connected with their operations, and until then I must ask the patience of the Department, especially since the service and thoughts of all here are really necessary for the efficient discharge of the momentous duties intrusted to us. 
Preliminary to that report, it may be of interest, however, to write somewhat less formally and generally of affairs here than in a battle report. 
The enemy having gained a lodgment on Morris Island, it was at once considered whether he could be dislodged when reinforcements had been received, and decided to be impracticable, for reasons that will be exhibited in a special paper hereafter.
It next became the question to determine what modifications in the system of defence must necessarily be introduced—first, by the lodgment already gained on Morris Island; and secondly, in case the whole island fell into the enemy's hands.
It was decided to prepare to make the stoutest possible defence of the works, one after the other, and in every possible way prolong our possession, to gain time to surround the enemy with such a fire as to make the island of little use to him as a place of offence against Fort Sumter, and to make other modifications of our defensive works to meet new conditions of attack. 
The contest, therefore, is now purely one of military engineering (especially since the uncommon slaughter which resulted from the two efforts, so signally foiled, to carry Battery Wagner), involving three elements essential to success— time, labor, and long-range guns, with sufficient and proper ammunition. 
Well aware of the pressure on the limited resources of the War Department, both of men and material, I endeavored to employ and handle my own to the best advantage to meet and repel the attempt by way of Morris Island, as soon as the point of attack was clearly revealed.
For only when that discovery was made could I venture to concentrate here the small, widely-scattered infantry force at my disposition.
This I did, but meantime, as reported, the enemy had assailed and carried our positions south of Battery Wagner, for the want of troops to effectually oppose them, for the lack of works of proper size and strength, and suitable armament, as I have always feared must be the result, if that method of attack were seriously resorted to by an officer of capacity, with the immense resources of the United States at his disposition. 
Charleston, it is proper to say, was assailable from three quarters: first, through James Island, via the Stono, left open by the abandonment of Cole's Island; secondly, by Morris Island, also left exposed by yielding Cole's Island; thirdly, by Sullivan's, via Long Island. 
The first point, being regarded as vital to the defence of the harbor and city, was guarded by 1184 infantry, 1569 artillery, and 153 cavalry, or 2906 men of all arms, instead of the force estimated heretofore, to wit, 11,500; the second point was occupied by 612 infantry, 289 artillerists, and 261 cavalry, or 1162 men, in lieu of about 3000 men of all arms; and the third point by 204 infantry, 726 artillerists, and 228 cavalry, or 1158 men, instead of at least 3500 men of all arms; while, in the City of Charleston, a small reserve of 870 cavalry, artillery, and infantry was maintained as a guard, and ready to be thrown, in an emergency, wherever the enemy might develop his point of attack, but principally to reinforce James Island. 
Leaving a force on Folly Island, after the attack in April, the enemy gave only occasional evidences of any intention to resort to the Morris Island way of attack, until a day or two before the south end of the island was carried, and at which time the defences on Morris Island consisted of Battery Wagner, an excellent work, located by General Pemberton, to play the important part it is now doing so well—that is, as a defence against an approach by land; and Battery Gregg, built as an additional defence to the mouth of the harbor, and to command the gorge of Battery Wagner, located by my orders, and erected by the lamented Captain Cheves. 
These batteries were nearly completed, lacking, however, certain heavy guns, most material to the perfection of their armaments.
In addition, certain batteries and infantry epaulements, projected, but delayed from want of labor,  were under construction at the southern extremity, and at other points near Morris Island, as counter dispositions to the demonstrations of the enemy on Folly Island. 
The force of the enemy may be set down as at least four brigades, of 2500 men each, or a total of some 10,000 men, with ample means of transportation and every appliance of war, supported by the guns of a powerful and numerous fleet. 
Making a strong demonstration against James Island, filling the Stono with gunboats and troops, and occupying Battery Island in force, the enemy, at the same time, vigorously attacked the small force available for defence of the south end of Morris Island with his main force, under cover of a powerful battery of long-range guns placed in a battery thrown up on the north end of Little Folly Island.
He soon overpowered the small force and weak batteries which alone could be opposed to his offensive movements at the time, and drove our troops out of their works, back to the shelter of Battery Wagner.
Nor could any effort be made to dislodge him before the arrival of reinforcements, by which time he had so firmly established his naturally strong position as to make any offensive attempt desperate and impracticable; that is, without the support of a strong naval force. 
It may be asked, why was not this catastrophe guarded against?
To which I have to say, generally, that stronger works could not be erected, for lack of labor, though every effort was exhausted to secure negroes from the day I took command of the Department up to the 1st of July, 1863. 
Further, I have not been able to get the armament essential for such works; and besides, as before said, I did not have a garrison sufficiently strong for Morris, James, and Sullivan's islands at the same time. 
The holding of the position was secondary to that of James Island, which must first be secured beyond peril, if possible, of surprise and capture.
But my reports to the War Department are full of these details, showing the relative positions and value of these approaches to and defences of Charleston; in fact, all the information necessary for a correct appreciation and comprehension of the state of affairs here. 
I shall, of course, allow no opportunity to pass for annoying the enemy, and shall make every effort to anticipate and foil my adversary, and, if practicable, dislodge him from his present position. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
Appendix to chapter XXXII.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 22d, 1863. Major H. C. Guerin, Chief of Subsistence, etc., etc.: 
Major,—It is the direction of the Commanding General that rations for ten thousand (10,000) men for two (2) months shall be kept in the city or its immediate  vicinity.
It is possible that there may be accessions to the number of troops at present here, and it is his wish that you shall take steps to procure such a further supply of provisions as may be necessary to meet the emergency. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 22d, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—I consider it advisable not to open fire with the works about Shell Point until entirely completed; otherwise the return fire of the enemy will compel us to work upon them only at night, thereby delaying them. 
A vigorous and constant fire with guns and mortars should be kept up on the enemy's works (especially at and about Vinegar Hill) from Wagner, Gregg, and Sumter.
No way of annoying them should be omitted; even sorties at night to fill up their rifle-pits, spike their guns, etc., should be resorted to whenever the night will favor such operations. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 24th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, etc., etc.: 
Colonel,—It is the wish of the Commanding General that the work on the Sullivan's Island Batteries, Simkins (Shell Point), Cheves, and Haskell (Legare's), shall be pushed forward, night and day. 
To do the work on hand the negroes must be divided in two parties, and these again subdivided into reliefs, as also the Engineers. 
Should there be a scarcity of laborers, the batteries below Battery Haskell may be delayed for the present. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 24th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—Your notes of this date, communicating the fact of the damage inflicted on the work and armament of Battery Wagner, have been laid before the Commanding General, who wishes General Taliaferro informed that that work must be held and fought to the last extremity consonant with legitimate warfare. 
Meantime, the garrison may be assured that every proper preparation will be made to withdraw them when their longer maintenance of the position shall be fruitless; and, to secure that end, you will make all necessary arrangements. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 24th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—The batteries designed to render Batteries Wagner and Gregg untenable by enemy, if reduced, not being completed, it has become exigent that these last batteries shall be held to the last extremity.
Wagner, being under guns of Sumter and Gregg, should be held by infantry and siege-guns alone, until its parapets and bomb-proofs are destroyed, and no longer afford shelter against artillery.
The General regards it almost improbable that another assault will be attempted. 
Furthermore, the evacuation of Wagner does not necessarily involve immediate abandonment of Gregg, which, with reduced garrison, and with sharpshooters filling the sand-hills between it and Wagner, may be held for several days longer. 
When obliged to quit either work the guns must be thoroughly disabled, by spiking, knocking off trunnions, cutting and burning carriages and bombproofs, and by blowing up the magazines and parapets. 
In view of the great improbability of an assault, may it not be well to reduce the garrison to a minimum to-morrow morning, just about two o'clock? 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 24th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, etc.: 
Colonel,—Examine condition for resistance of Battery Wagner, and report in person as soon as possible.
Explain to General Taliaferro that we must fight the fleet with sand — that the battery originally was only meant to defend against land approach.
The battery must be held as long as possible; even twenty-four hours are important. 
Respectfully, etc., G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 24th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—The Commanding General desires five of the 8-inch naval guns, now in the casemates at Fort Sumter, to be sent, via Fort Johnson, to the new battery on James Island designated as Battery Cheves; also another from Battery Haig, on Stono, with the necessary amount and species of ammunition. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 25th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. and Chief-Engineer D. B. Harris, etc., etc.: 
Colonel,—It is the wish of the Commanding General that two batteries for two columbiads each shall be constructed between Fort Moultrie and Battery Beauregard, Sullivan's Island.  
He also wishes you to determine what new batteries for 24-pounders or 32-pounders may be required between Batteries Beauregard and Marshall, to be constructed by Clingman's brigade, after consultation with General Ripley, the object being to replace the fire of Fort Sumter, which was liable to be silenced sooner or later by the Federal batteries being erected on Morris Island. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 25th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—The Commander of the forces is of opinion that it will be judicious to reduce the command in occupation of Morris Island to twelve hundred (1200) men, of which only the minimum garrison should be kept in Battery Wagner during the day. Should this accord with your views, you will please give the proper orders in the premises. 
May it not be well to place several of the mortars now in Fort Sumter in the parade of that post, for the purpose of shelling Morris Island? 
The fire at Fort Sumter, and Batteries Gregg and Simkins (Shell Point), the Commanding General thinks, should be concentrated on the field included between Battery Wagner and the Graham House, day and night—that is, say one gun, from the batteries collectively, at least every ten minutes, or possibly every five minutes, during the night.
Each battery should be informed from District Headquarters of the exact range from thence to Batteries Gregg and Wagner respectively, and must mark plainly the direction of each piece, so that, at night, there may be no difficulty in getting the range with accuracy and celerity. 
A rifle-pit, if not already thrown up, should be made from Battery Gregg to high-water line on its right and left flank. 
It is thought that some of the firing from Battery Gregg is not as accurate as could be secured with more deliberation.
Please caution the zealous and active young officer in command there on this point. 
The Commanding General particularly desires to know what guns have already been removed from Fort Sumter since the 10th inst., and to what points transferred. 
He also desires hereafter a daily report as to the removal and disposition of Fort Sumter guns. 
The batteries on Sullivan's Island ought to be armed and ready for action as soon as possible. 
Respectfully, General, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 27th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—Colonel Frederick states that he receives so many contradictory reports as to the effect of the fire from the batteries under his direction, that he is unable to give proper instructions for the correction of inaccurate aim and ineffective  fire.
This may be remedied, in the opinion of the Commanding General, by making it the duty of some officer at Fort Sumter to observe all shots fired at the enemy on Morris Island from Batteries Simkins and Cheves (when ready), and from Fort Johnson, and to communicate the effect by signal direct to Colonel Frederick, at Fort Johnson. 
The mortar fuses used at Battery Simkins appear to be too short.
If not already corrected, please have them remedied as soon as possible. 
It is regarded as essential that there should be constantly on Morris Island an efficient local staff, especially an ordinance officer and quartermaster and commissary of the most active and intelligent character.
This may be best secured by detailing two of each department to alternate with each other every five days. Their habitual station will be Cummings's Point, but they will be expected to visit both batteries frequently, and to be responsible for the efficiency of their respective departments at each post. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 27th, 1863. Capt. John R. Tucker, C. S. N., etc., etc.: 
Captain,—Will it not be possible for you to place your two ships—the ironclads—in a position immediately contiguous to Cummings's Point—that is, at a point within one and a half miles—your maximum range, as I understand—of the enemy's nearest line of land-batteries, whence, with your Brooke and other guns, you can take part in the operations against those batteries, and materially strengthen our means of defence and hold on Morris Island? 
Doubtless the ironclad vessels of the enemy would attempt to drive you away, and you might possibly have to retire, but not without forcing them to be brought under the heavy guns of Battery Gregg and the batteries on Sullivan's Island, as also of Fort Sumter.
An important diversion would be effected at least, and it is presumed you could always retire in time to avoid serious consequences from an unequal conflict. 
The question for determination would appear to be, whether there is water enough at any point near enough to Cummings's Point to enable you to take up a position within 2600 yards of any battery of the enemy on Morris Island, and this can only be determined definitely, I apprehend, by soundings, which I hope you will have made without delay. 
The time to take the position, if practicable at all, would be as soon as the enemy begins a serious bombardment again of Battery Wagner, which may be anticipated at any moment. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 28th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, etc., etc.: 
Colonel,—The Commanding General desires the empty gun chambers and passages at Battery Gregg to be converted into bomb-proofs.
Filled sand-bags must likewise be held in readiness there, and in Batteries Wagner and Simkins, for repairs. 
The sand-slopes at Battery Simkins will be codded as soon as possible, as a preservation against the effects of the wind. 
The channel at the west end of Sullivan's Island must be obstructed as far as practicable with the old boom and torpedoes, to prevent monitors from taking positions in that quarter, whence to take in reverse or enfilade Battery Bee. 
Boats and flats should be collected in safest place in the creek in the rear of Sullivan's Island, to establish communication with Christ Church Parish, in case the bridge shall be destroyed. 
Lookouts or observatories should be erected in Batteries Cheves, Haskell, and Ryan, to watch effect of practice. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., July 28th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—The Commanding General directs that the six (6) 8-inch columbiads to be removed from Fort Sumter shall be distributed as follows: one in Battery Simkins; one in Battery Haskell; two in Battery Cheves; and two in the battery east of Moultrie. 
The five (5) 8-inch naval shell-guns from Fort Moultrie he directs to be mounted in Battery Cheves. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Jno. F.  O'Brien, Major, and A. A. G. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 1st, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, etc., etc.: 
Colonel,—The Commanding General instructs me to direct you to place in front and in the ditches of Battery Wagner trous de loups, and also boards with sharp nails or spikes in the bottom of the ditches above referred to, as already verbally instructed by the General Commanding. 
Very respectfully, Colonel, your obedient servant, Clifton H.  Smith, Assist. Adjt.-Genl. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 2d, 1863. Capt. J. R. Tucker, etc., etc.: 
Captain,—In reply to your request for my opinion whether the private steamvessels which have been seized by you can render more important service by going abroad than by being retained for the defence of the harbor, I have to say that I am convinced the time for their effective employment for the defence of this harbor is now, in some effort to destroy at night the Ironsides and other ironclad vessels of the enemy, which are being formidably used for the reduction  of our works on Morris Island.
If they are not speedily applied to that end, or cannot with sufficient hope of success to warrant or induce the attempt, but are to be held in the inner harbor, only to be resorted to in the last extremity against ironclads that shall have overpowered our outworks and reduced or passed Forts Sumter and Moultrie, then I am clearly satisfied their further retention as a means of defence is useless, and that it will be far better to release them at once, as requested by the Quartermaster's department, to be sent abroad for military supplies.
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 2d, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, etc., etc.: 
Colonel,—The Commanding General directs that a battery for two 24pound-ers be thrown up between Battery Beauregard and the new Middle Battery, in Sullivan's Island, and that another shall be erected between the latter battery and Battery Marshall for two 32-pounders. 
Two columbiad platforms in mortar batteries at Fort Johnson will be taken up and transferred to some point at which they may be needed, and their places supplied by platforms for barbette guns. 
Have any of the star-torpedoes been sent afloat in the Stono?
If not, what is the obstacle to its being done? 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 3d, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—The Commanding General directs me to say that he wishes one banded and rifled 32-pounder sent to-night to Battery Wagner, to be mounted in place of the one which was bursted some time ago. Also one mortar to be sent from Fort Sumter to Battery Gregg. 
He also desires that you should furnish Fort Sumter and Sullivan's Island at once with everything in the way of provisions, ammunitions, etc., that may be required for their prolonged defence; for should the north end of Morris Island fall into the hands of the enemy, little if any intercourse by water could be kept up with those posts.
For the same reason he calls your attention specially to the immediate necessity of transporting to Sullivan's Island all the guns and ammunition which can be spared from Fort Sumter.
These matters cannot be attended to with too much expedition. 
The movement of troops to Morris Island the General wishes so conducted that for the present there shall not be less than two regiments of infantry so located at night on Sullivan's Island as to prevent any surprise.
The habitual force on Morris Island he desires reduced to one thousand men. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 3d, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, etc., etc.: 
Colonel,—The Commanding General wishes six floating torpedoes to be carried down Light-house Inlet, at night, and let loose as near the enemy's vessels as practicable.
Colonel L. M. Hatch is a gentleman who, if provided with boats and torpedoes, could attend to the execution of this order, and would probably undertake it. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Jno. F.  O'Brien, Major, and A. A. G.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 4th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—In a recent visit of the Commanding General to Morris Island and Fort Sumter he noticed the following matters, to which he directs me to call your attention, and desires that you carry out his views in regard thereto. 
Battery Gregg is in want of many small things, such as fuse-gauges, etc., and more particularly of shells, for which things requisitions have been made, but never filled. 
At Battery Wagner the system and order are not as they should be, especially in the ordnance department.
Staff-officers relieving each other do not leave a return of property in their keeping, but start off without turning over anything.
This should be remedied—all officers remaining at the post until they shall have turned over all property or instructions to their successors.
The general officers there have heretofore kept no book of orders to transmit to their successors.
The General wishes you to have one prepared and sent forthwith to Morris Island of all back orders, which henceforth will be regularly kept up and turned over to the commanding officer who relieves.
This book lie wishes an inspector to examine weekly.
The battery is often short of ammunition and provisions.
An ample supply of both should always be kept on hand.
The General wishes ten days provisions for twelve hundred men kept constantly on hand at the post.
He thinks it advisable that you should visit Morris Island at least once or twice each week, and directs that one of your staff-officers be sent there at least as often as every other night, to report on any irregularities he may observe. 
The General advises the removal of the two 8-inch columbiads from the east face of Fort Sumter, to make room for traverses, and the placing there of the 7-inch Brooke gun from the northeast salient angle—the latter gun to be replaced by the 10-inch columbiad now next to it. A 42-pounder on the northeast face, near another 10-inch columbiad, should be removed to the Bee batteries, so as to allow room for the protection from Morris Island fire by traverses in rear of the two 10-inch columbiads already referred to. The 10-inch columbiad at the northwest salient should also be protected from the same direction by a traverse. 
The two rifled 32-pounders now in casemates should be mounted at once on  the south face in place of two 24-pounders, which should be sent to the city for banding and rifling. 
The mortars on the gorge should be lowered to the parades, the arches being too weak to withstand the shock of heavy charges; three only should be kept at Sumter, and the others not already disposed of (if any) should be sent to Battery Simkins or Sullivan's Island.
The 8-inch columbiad removed from the northeast face he wishes sent to Batteries Bee or Fort Moultrie. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Jno. F.  O'Brien, Major, and A. A. G. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 4th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—The enemy have a picket, it appears, at night in the Marsh Battery Creek, at or near the battery, for the purpose of observing and reporting when our steamers are at Cummings's Point.
The Commanding General desires to prevent this if possible, and thinks it may be best done by the navy—to which end he wishes you to see and, if possible, arrange with Captain Tucker for this service. 
The mouths of all the creeks debouching in the cove between Morris Island and Shell Point (Battery Simkins) should be watchfully picketed at night, and, if practicable, the enemy's pickets just alluded to should be surprised and captured. 
A boat picket thrown out from Legare's Point, in the creek, might also be effective. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 6th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—After reading your letter of this date, touching the number of troops, etc., on Morris Island, the Commanding General is induced to say that he regards a force of one thousand men as quite sufficient.
However, it will be but a proper precaution to be ready to throw there a larger force, in event of danger of assault. 
Colonel Keith, in his report, regrets that he was unable to fire at the monitor on the night of the—instant, which had come within some one thousand or twelve hundred yards of Battery Wagner.
It is not the wish of the Commanding General that the 10-inch guns in that work should be hastily unmasked, at a range as distant as a thousand yards; it were best to reserve them for use against ironclads which may come as close as was done by the Ironsides recently.
Please give the orders to insure rigid adherence to these views of the Commanding General. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 8th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—The Commanding General wishes you at once to organize day and night working-parties at Fort Sumter, to put up the sand-bag chemise of the gorge-wall, the interior traverses, merlons, and embrasures he has ordered; he desires that not an hour should be lost in executing those improvements, on which depends the safety of Sumter. 
Lieutenant-Colonel Harris, Engineer, has been directed to construct a covered way between Batteries Gregg and Wagner, and the Commanding General wishes you to furnish him any facility in your power for its speedy completion. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Jno. F.  O'Brien, Major, and A. A. G. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 9th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, etc., etc.: 
Colonel,—I am instructed to communicate the following views and wishes of the Commanding General for your guidance. 
The existing defensive lines on James Island, with a trace of seven miles, reaching from Fort Pemberton to Secessionville, as I always feared, are so defective that it has become clearly injudicious to expend much more labor on them.
You will, therefore, now that we can command labor, lay out and erect a shorter line, beginning at Secessionville and resting on the Stono at Dill's house—that is, about two miles and a half in extent—and which may at first be made up of four (4) redans, which should be converted into redoubts, or lunettes with closed gorges, disposed from one-half (1/2) to three-quarters of a mile apart, and connected with cremaillere lines. 
The first (1st) of these redans, from Secessionville, should be armed with three (3) guns; the second (2d) with four (4); the third (3d), on the Stono, with six (6); and the fourth (4th), also on the Stono, with four (4) guns—all of which will be transferred from the present lines, and from Fort Sumter or other forts, as they may be best spared. 
The two works on the Stono must be heavily armed, while the river should be obstructed to the utmost extent practicable with torpedoes, extending below the work, if practicable, a mile and a half. 
The scarp-wall at Fort Sumter over the new gate-way will be supported in the way verbally indicated by the Commander of the forces. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquaiters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 12th, 1862. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—The Commanding General desires that the expedition for the seizure of Black Island shall take place on the same night (Friday), when an effort will be made to put torpedoes afloat in Light-house Inlet.
Colonel  Simonton should confer with Major Elliott, who has charge of the torpedo operations. 
As soon as possible it will be prudent to fill in the parade at Fort Sumter with sand, as precaution against the effect of shell on the ground as now standing. 
A fire-engine and proper amount of hose, etc., should be procured from the city authorities to be kept in Fort Sumter. 
It has been suggested that it were judicious to paint our guns and carriages on Morris Island and elsewhere a sand or neutral-tint color.
This the Commanding General approves. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headqiarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 14th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, etc., etc.: 
General,—I am instructed to say that the two 32-pounder rifled pieces sent to Fort Johnson from Fort Sumter will be required for the new works on the new defensive line from Secessionville to the Stono.
The 32-pounder (not rifled) now in Redoubt No. 1 will likewise be transferred to the same works. 
The 10-inch columbiad directed yesterday to be put in battery on Sullivan's Island, east or west of Fort Sumter, the Commanding General authorizes to be sent to the battery near the old tower on James Island, unless it shall have been transported as previously indicated. 
The Engineers will be directed to prepare positions for two additional guns at or near Fort Johnson, to bear on the harbor—that is, for a 10-inch columbiad and the 8-inch rifled piece which you report as nearly finished. 
Lieutenant Vanzandt, naval ordnance officer, upon direct application to him, will, by Commodore Ingraham's instructions, afford assistance, with skilful hands, in putting down the circle for the treble-banded gun. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 15th, 1863. His Excellency M. L. Bonham, Governor, etc., etc.: 
Sir,—I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 12th inst. on yesterday, bringing again to my notice that the Sovereign Convention of the State of South Carolina had, on the 8th of January, 1862, declared it to be the sense of the people of South Carolina, assembled in Convention, that Charleston should be defended at any cost of life or property; and that, in their deliberate judgment, they would prefer a repulse of the enemy, with the entire city in ruins, to an evacuation or surrender on any terms whatever; and further, that you were informed that, the attention of my predecessors in command having been called to this subject by the Governor and Council, General Lee had directed that Charleston should be defended to the last extremity,  and, if necessary, the fight should be made from street to street and from house to house.
You are entirely right in your belief that I propose to defend the city to the last extremity, in accordance with the patriotic wishes of the people of South Carolina and the instructions of my superiors. 
I agree that non-combatants, as far as practicable, should be removed in time to avoid the possibility of any serious obstruction to or injurious effect on the defence by their presence, and trust that the proper authorities will be able to effect that desirable object; but I am unable to set any day after which summary measures, in my judgment, may be proper to secure the removal of all not useful in the defence. 
At my instance, early in July the Mayor of the city, by proclamation, called on non-combatants to quit the city during the operations of the enemy for its reduction.
Many left, but in a very few days began to return.
I then took measures to prevent this by issuing an order to the railroads to refuse a return passage.
The operation or effect was to overwhelm my office and engross precious time with the consideration of urgent applications for permission to return, until I was forced to withdraw virtually the interdict; and such have been the results of every previous effort to induce non-combatants to leave and remain out of the city, that I fear no effort to that end will be successful until it may be too late. 
I will, however, be happy to do what I can to assist the Commission, or other State or city authorities, in removing all who, by reason of age, sex, or infirmity, may be incapable of taking part in the defence of the city. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 16th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, etc., etc.: 
Colonel,—I am instructed to direct the following work to be done by your department of the Staff: 
To arrange the batteries at Fort Johnson, with platforms, etc., for two additional 10-inch columbiads, in lieu of the 32-pounder rifled and two 32-pounder smooth-bores now there, but which will be transferred to the new advanced lines. 
Prepare positions for platforms at once for three (3) 10-inch columbiads near the Martello Tower, James Island. 
Place two platforms for 10-inch columbiads in Battery Glover. 
Add a small redan for one or two guns in each interval between the large redan or lunettes of the newly ordered line to the Stono, and which subsequently will all be connected together by cremaillere lines, with openings properly arranged for the free passage of troops. 
At the earliest day practicable the Commanding General desires his orders to be executed for the construction of covered ways between Batteries Gregg and Wagner, and from Fort Johnson to Battery Simkins. 
It was observed by the Commanding General that the laborers appeared to  be too much crowded in the works inspected by him. This should be avoided as far as possible, and it may be well to impose tasks. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 16th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—As you were informed yesterday, it is the wish of the Commanding General that one of the mortars at Fort Sumter should be transferred with the utmost despatch to Battery Gregg; the other two he wishes, as soon as they cannot be used advantageously in Fort Sumter, to be removed to Battery Haskell. 
It will be prudent to see that every gun not actually required for the defence of Fort Sumter, and the new relations of that work to the general defence of the harbor, shall be removed without loss of time; some of them (heavy guns) should go to Castle Pinckney as soon as that work shall be properly strengthened by sand-bags.
The other heavy and light pieces should be distributed, as already indicated, between the works on Sullivan's and James islands; some of the light guns to be transferred to the city. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 17th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., S. C., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,,—Order the long-range guns in Battery Haskell to open at once on enemy's works on Morris Island, especially his battery of heavy guns used against Fort Sumter. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 17th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., S. C., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—All the heavy guns that have been disabled in Fort Sumter to-day, by being dismounted, the Commanding General wishes you to have removed without delay to other works—that is, to Sullivan's Island and to Fort Johnson. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 18th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., S. C., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—Lieutenant-Colonel Kemper, it appears, is confined to the command of the light artillery under General Hagood.
The Commanding General prefers that he should, as an assistant to the Chief of Artillery, have the command  of all the light artillery on James Island, and be responsible for its discipline and efficiency.
Please give the necessary orders to that end. 
Major Elliott will also be ordered to report to Brigadier-General Taliaferro for assignment to command of such heavy artillery as may be without proper commander. 
The south end of the quarters at Fort Moultrie next to the guns should be torn away and removed without delay, otherwise the battery may be made untenable. 
The Chief-Engineer will be instructed to examine Fort Moultrie, to determine what additional traverses shall be constructed in that work.
The Commanding General is convinced one well-protected gun is worth ten exposed to a flank fire, and is keenly solicitous that all should be done to guard against such an event.
Therefore it will be necessary to remove some guns, probably, to make room for the traverses which the Chief-Engineer may wish to throw up. In that event no time must be lost in taking the guns down when the Engineers are ready to do the work.
Colonel Butler should be instructed to confer with Colonel Harris touching the guns to be displaced. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 18th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chf.-Eng. Dept. S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C.: 
Colonel,—The Commanding General directs that you will repair to Fort Sumter as soon as practicable, to examine the damage done that work, and to recommend such repairs as are deemed advisable.
You will also determine with Colonel Rhett what heavy guns should be transferred from Fort Sumter to the batteries at Fort Johnson and near the Martello Tower.
These guns are to be removed to-night, if possible. 
The General further directs that you will select a competent officer of your corps to inspect Captain Gray's torpedoes which are already made and ready for use. 
You will also cause additional torpedoes to be placed in the Ashley River, and the mouths of Dill's Creek and Wappoo Cut, if the steamers to be used for this purpose are not indispensable for the supply of the troops on James Island. 
Further, the General directs that you will close the opening through the rope obstructions near Fort Sumter, if practicable, and have a new opening made near Moultrie.
The houses near the batteries on James Island must be torn down. 
In conclusion, the General directs that you will construct two more sunken positions for heavy guns, near the Martello Tower (making five there in all), and also a work at the old mortar battery near Mount Pleasant, to cover Hog Island Channel, the inner harbor, and the bridge to Sullivan's Island. 
Lieutenant G. Young will be ordered to report to you to take charge of the harbor torpedoes, in addition to his other duties. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Clifton H.  Smith, A. A. G.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 19th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. D. B. Harris, Chf.-Eng., Dept. S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C.: 
Colonel,—Castle Pinckney must now be put in a condition, as soon as practicable, to become an effective part of the interior lines; to which end all labor and filled sand-bags and other material should be diverted from Fort Sumter that cannot be applied there (evidently to prolong its defence to any material extent), and used for traverses and a protection to the scarp-wall of the former work. 
Fort Moultrie should be supplied amply with empty sand-bags, for the building of traverses, now and hereafter. 
The covered way between Fort Moultrie and Battery Beauregard must be put in effective condition as soon as practicable. 
Construct a battery for two 10-inch columbiads near the new wharf on James Island. 
Three platforms for columbiads will be sufficient for the present in the battery near the Martello Tower, and the same number at the battery ordered near the wharf at Fort Johnson. 
Have as many torpedoes prepared as possible to be set afloat, should the enemy force his way into the harbor. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C. August 20th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., etc., etc.: 
General,—Please be particular to see that as many shot-guns, with buck-shot ammunition, shall be sent to Battery Wagner without fail, to be held in readiness for an attempt to storm the place. 
The Commanding General wishes every effort made to keep the batteries on Morris Island supplied with proper ammunition. 
Has a new columbiad carriage been sent to Battery Gregg? 
Order Colonel Butler, by telegraph, to confer with Colonel Gilmer, Chief-Engineer, C. S. A., and Lieutenant-Colonel Harris, Chief-Engineer Department, now on Sullivan's Island, in order to determine what 8 or 10-inch columbiads can best be removed from any Sullivan's Island work to the new battery to be established at Mount Pleasant. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 21st, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., etc., etc.: 
General,—The Commanding General desires you to order, by telegraph, Colonel Rhett, at once, to protect, by all possible means (and thoroughly), the extreme gun on the right of the east and northeast faces; also to remove the  next gun in each case, and place instead a heavy sand-traverse, and so on, successively, to the left, so as to have an effective traverse alternating with the guns. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 21st, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., etc., etc.: 
General,—Henceforth the Commanding General directs that only the best troops be sent to Morris Island, twelve hours notice being given them, in order that they may prepare provisions, etc. The General directs me to communicate the following for your information. 
The Engineers have been instructed to protect Battery Beauregard, by efficient traverses, from a reverse fire from Cummings's Point, in case the latter place should fall into the hands of the enemy.
They have also been directed to prepare new batteries near Fort Johnson for the guns and mortars of Battery Simkins, if rendered untenable, and to at once close up the opening in rope obstructions near Fort Sumter, reopening one near Moultrie. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Jno. F.  O'Brien, Major, and A. A. G.

 Headquarters, Department of the South, Morris Island, S. C., August 22d, 1863:9 P. M. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, Comdg. Confederate Forces, Charleston, S. C.: 
Sir,—I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of this date, complaining that one of my batteries has opened upon the City of Charleston, and thrown a number of heavy rifled shells into the city, the inhabitants of which, of course, were asleep and unwarned.
My letter to you demanding the surrender of Fort Sumter and Morris Island, and threatening, in default thereof, to open fire upon Charleston, was delivered near Fort Wagner at 11.15 o'clock A. M. on the 21st instant, and should have arrived at your headquarters in time to have permitted your answer to reach me within the limit assigned—viz., four hours. The fact that you were absent from your headquarters at the time of its arrival may be regarded as an unfortunate circumstance for the City of Charleston, but is one for which I clearly am not responsible.
This letter bore date at my headquarters, and was officially delivered by an officer of my staff. 
The inadvertent omission of my signature doubtless affords ground for special pleading, but it is not the argument of a commander solicitous only for the safety of sleeping women and children and unarmed men. Your threats of retaliation for acts of mine, which you do not allege to be in violation of the usages of civilized warfare, except as regards the length of time allowed as notice of my intentions, are passed by without comment.
I will, however, call your attention to the well-established principle, that the commander of a place attacked, but not invested, having its avenues of escape open and practicable, has no right to expect any notice of an intended bombardment other than that which is given by the threatening attitude of his adversary.
Even had this letter not been written, the City of Charleston has had, according to your own computation, forty days notice of her danger. 
During that time my attack on her defences has steadily progressed; the ultimate object of that attack has at no time been doubtful.
If, under the circumstances, the life of a single non-combatant is exposed to peril by the bombardment of the city, the responsibility rests with those who have first failed to remove the non-combatants or secure the safety of the city, after having held control of all its approaches for a period of nearly two years and a half, in the presence of a threatening force, and who afterwards refused to accept terms upon which the bombardment might have been postponed. 
From various sources, official and otherwise, I am led to believe that most of the women and children of Charleston were long since removed from the city; but, upon your assurance that the city is still full of them, I shall suspend the bombardment until 11 o'clock P. M. to-morrow, thus giving you two days from the time you acknowledge to have received my communication of the 21st instant. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Q. A.  Gillmore, Brig.-Genl. Comdg. 
Appendix to chapter XXXIII.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 24th, 1863. Commander J. R. Tucker, Flag-officer, etc., Charleston, S. C.: 
Sir,—The condition of Fort Sumter-its inability to offer further substantial reply with heavy ordnance to the enemy's fleet—makes it in place for me to acquaint you formally with the fact, and to ask you to take up a position with the three ironclad vessels under your command between Batteries Bee and other works on Sullivan's Island and Fort Sumter, for the purpose of assisting in protecting the latter, and in preventing the United States ironclads from passing into the harbor.
It is believed you can take such a position under Fort Sumter as would shelter you from a flank fire from enemy's land batteries. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
General Beauregard's Indorsement on Colonels Gilmer and Harris's report of the condition of Sumter on the 24th of August, 1863. Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 26th, 1863. 
The opinion of Colonel Gilmer and Lieutenant-Colonel Harris, of the Engineers, is approved.
Fort Sumter must be held to the last extremity—i. e., not surrendered until it becomes impossible to hold it longer without an unnecessary sacrifice of human life.
Evacuation of the fort must not be contemplated an instant without positive orders from these Headquarters. G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg.

 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 27th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., etc., etc.: 
General,—The Commanding General directs me to say that the commanding officer at Fort Sumter must be instructed that the position shall be held and defended to the last extremity, and not surrendered until it cannot be longer held without an unnecessary sacrifice of life.
It will only be evacuated under explicit orders from these Headquarters. 
Remove all powder except two hundred (200) rounds for each of, say, three guns, which it is hoped may be mounted and kept serviceable.
No efforts should be spared to remove as many projectiles as possible of the most valuable sort. 
As previously directed, the number of negroes must likewise be reduced as much as may be compatible with the labor to be done, to insure our holding the position. 
A four weeks supply of provisions, for the garrison and employes, should be placed in store in the fort. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff.

 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 29th, 1863. Lieut.-Col. J. R. Waddy, Chf. Ord. Dept. S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C.: 
Colonel,—The Commanding General directs that the 10-inch columbiad brought up last night from Fort Sumter, and now on Commercial Wharf, be sent to Battery Wampler (between Martello Tower and Battery Glover). He also wishes you to see Commodore Ingraham, and offer him the 9-inch Dahlgren, brought up at the same time, for the use of the new gunboat, informing him of the accident which befell the piece in removing it from the fort. 
Your attention is respectfully called to the fact that there are no howitzer shells at Battery Wagner.
That these should be supplied as speedily as possible  is a matter of much moment, and the Commanding General directs that you make every possible effort to procure them forthwith. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Jno. F.  O'Brien, Major, and A. A. G. 
P. S.—Captain F. D. Lee has been directed to turn over to you the iron you requested. J. F. O'B.

 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 30th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—In consequence of the revelations of the United States gunboat Ottowa's mail-bag it behooves us to be on the alert, and to be prepared for another such attempt as that which was made by Admiral Dahlgren oh the 26th inst. (Wednesday night) to pass the obstructions and force his way into this harbor.
The Commanding General has addressed Flag-officer Tucker on the subject, and he also desires you to see and arrange with that officer for a guardboat (Juno, if possible), which shall be so placed at night as to secure timely  information of an advance of the enemy.
He thinks that vessels prepared with light wood or resin should likewise be moored at proper points at night, to be set on fire and light up the harbor. 
All the batteries on either side of the channel should be placed in condition, and held ready for immediate service.
He further wishes those guns (10-inch and the Brooke piece) for Battery Wampler placed in condition for service with the utmost despatch, and supplied with the requisite ammunition.
Opportunely forewarned, we must be forearmed and prepared at all points. 
Respectfully, your obdt.
servt., Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff.

 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 31st, 1863. Lieutenant-Colonel D. B. Harris, Chief-Engineer, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C.: 
Colonel,—The Commanding General directs that to-night you place a large number of torpedoes in front of the obstructions between Forts Sumter and Moultrie, principally from first works to half way across.
You will also, as soon as practicable, place additional torpedoes in Hog Island Channel, towards Sullivan's Island Point; in Folly Island Channel, and in the Middle Channel east of Pinckney.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, John F.  O'Brien, Major, and A. A. G. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 31st, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., Charleston, S. C.:

1st.
A list of the guns removed from Fort Sumter to other works since the 7th of April to date, and one of all guns that have burst, or been otherwise permanently disabled. 
2d.
That Castle Pinckney and Fort Ripley be well provisioned and supplied with ammunition, and that the orders heretofore issued relative to the provisioning and ammunitioning of Morris, James, and Sullivan's islands, and Christ Church Parish, if not already complied with, shall be at once executed. 
3d.
That you direct Colonel Rhett to use his sharp-shooters freely, in case of a night attempt on part of the enemy to destroy our rope obstructions; to this end he should have some of the best rifles and riflemen. 
4th.
As soon as the new harbor batteries on James Island west of Fort Johnson are furnished with guns they are to be supplied with ammunition and manned. 
5th.
All harbor batteries must be kept prepared to open fire any night, at a moment's notice, until further orders. 
Gth. That as soon as the remaining guns of Sumter are dismounted or rendered unserviceable the artillery company now there must be relieved by a company of infantry. 
7th.
That the carriages and chassis for heavy guns be removed from Sumter as soon and rapidly as practicable.

Sir,—Your two letters of this date have been received, and I hasten to say that it is my wish to turn over to you the torpedo-ram steamer, for any purpose or service for which you may regard it as suitable or available at this juncture, and until it may be found convenient and judicious to mail and arrange her as originally designed. 
General Ripley will be directed to make all practicable arrangements in accordance with your views conveyed in your letter relative to your inability to furnish further aid in keeping up communications with Morris Island.

The entire terre-plein on the northeast face, except the two casemates having commissary stores, have fallen in; two shots have gone into the commissary stores. Alfred  Rhett, Col. Comdg. 
 Sumter, Sept. 1st. 
The effect of fire to-day very heavy.
Three hundred and sixty-one shot fired: 166 outside, 75 inside, 120 over.
Two shells struck in commissary stores, on the southeast face of the outside wall.
Pan-coupe and next two arches have fallen.
The rest of the wall is badly scaled, and in all probability will come down tomorrow as low as the first tier of casemates.
We have not, a gun en barbette that can be fired.
Only one gun in casemate. A.  Rhett, Col. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Sept. 1st, 1863. Jno. S.  Mcdaniel, Kingstree, S. C.: 
Sir,—I regret that you have found planters so ready with excuses for not furnishing labor to defend Charleston.
May God grant that, in seeking to avoid furnishing a fourth of their labor at this momentous juncture, they do not materially contribute to the loss of the whole. 
If unable to find road commissioners who will loyally assist you in your duties, call on the planters to give you, in good faith, a list of their able-bodied male negroes between ages of eighteen and forty-five, and also a statement of what amount of labor they have severally furnished on the works in South Carolina.
Every man in the district must be required to send one-fourth, including that already furnished.
Should you find, after trial, that this does not work, take one-fourth, irrespective of former contributions, except from those who voluntarily furnished labor at my call last February and March. 
Working on railroads cannot be taken as ground of exemption. 
Negroes found in your district—refugees—of course must fare the same with others.
Send back all negroes who have run away from the works. 
I repeat as far as practicable impress the slaves of those who hitherto have not furnished labor. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff.  
 Sumter, Sept. 2d. 
Extract from Journal Kept at Post. 
September 1st.—The entire day 382 shot and shell fired at fort: 166 struck outside, 95 inside, 121 missed. 
At 11.40 P. M. six monitors and the Ironsides moved up and commenced shelling the fort.
One hundred and eighty-five shot were fired, until 5 o'clock A. M.: 116 struck outside, 35 inside, 34 over. * * * Ordnance stores shipped by Etiwan. * * * Damage very great by day and night fire.
On northeast face entire terreplein has fallen in, except next northeast pan-coupe. Two shells burst in commissary stores. * * * Since monitor fire last night every casemate, upper and lower, has been more or less breached, in most of them exposing sand-bags.
Three shells exploded in immediate proximity to western magazine, two so near to outer door of lower magazine passage, that, had the door been open, most serious consequences would have ensued.
The third struck and brought up in sand-bag traverse at passage into hospital magazine; would otherwise have gone into hospital passage used for guard-room.
Slightly wounded: Privates Foshu, Colonel Rhett's orderly; Brown, Company C; and Alexander, Company H, 27th Georgia Volunteers. A.  Rhett, Col. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Sept. 2d, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—It has been brought to the knowledge of the Commanding General, as a positive fact, that the supply of powder and the means of making powder have been diminished to a degree which makes it necessary to use the utmost economy in the expenditure of powder.
I am therefore instructed to acquaint you with the state of the case, and to request you to give such instructions as will effectually prevent any waste.
The batteries on Sullivan's Island last night, it is believed, threw away almost every pound of powder and iron discharged. 
The fire of the enemy, mainly directed at Fort Sumter, was on their side an evident waste of ammunition and a useless expenditure of strength of the ordnance employed—that is, just such an employment of his formidable means of offence as we should desire.
The batteries on Sullivan's Island will therefore be placed under such restrictions as shall effectually prevent them hereafter from firing at the ironclads at a range beyond that at which the Keokuk was perforated, on the 7th of April, 1863. 
It is the wish of the Commanding General that battery commanders shall be made to understand distinctly what is expected in this matter. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Sumter, Sept. 3d. 
Extract from Journal Kept at Post. 
September 2d.—Thirty-eight shots fired at fort this day: 12 struck outside, 9 inside, and 17 missed. * * * No material damage.
One shot penetrated scarp-wall,  opening daylight into magazine in southeast pan-coupe Negroes worked all day repairing previous damage, and strengthening west magazine. * * * Garrison worked all day. Casemates on east face filled with sand-bags.
Lieutenant John Johnson, Engineer officer, was relieved from duty at this post on account of aggravated condition of wound, and Lieutenant Hall, Engineer officer, reported for duty in his stead.
Mr. William Mathews was also sent down to assist the latter.
Mr. Fraser Mathews came last night for the purpose of taking off guns from berme, but in consequence of roughness of water was unable to do any work. Alfred  Rhett, Col. Comdg. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Sept. 3d, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., S. C., Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—The 32-pounder rifle-gun, brought from Fort Sumter several days ago, the Commanding General wishes transferred to the new battery under construction at Chisolm's Mill. 
Two of the three 42-pounder rifle and banded guns to be taken out of Fort Sumter may be sent at once to Fort Johnson, and the third will be brought to the city for disposition. 
The 11-inch Brooke gun, referred to in your letter of the 2d instant, will be dismounted and sent to the city for examination by Mr. Cameron and future orders. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., August 28th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. R. S. Ripley, Comdg. First Mil. Dist., etc., etc.: 
General,—I am informed, to my utter surprise, that the Hon. Secretary of War is of the following opinion relative to the attack of the enemy on Morris Island on the 10th ult. * * * 
You will please make to these Headquarters, at your earliest convenience, a full and detailed report on the subject, referring especially to the following points: 
1st.
Was not the presence of the enemy in force on Folly and Little Folly islands known?
And to what extent was his movements ascertained? 
2d.
What measures had been adopted, ordered, or contemplated for the protection of the south end of Morris Island, including flanking batteries on Black Island, commanding crossing of Light-house Inlet, and at Marsh Point, to flank Morris Island in front of Wagner? 
3d.
Why were not all those works constructed?
And, if constructed, could they have been armed? 
4th.
Even with works on the south end of Morris Island, and the small force then available for its defence, could not the enemy have landed, with the assistance of their gunboats and ironclad fleet, a strong force on the beach north of Craig's Hill, during the night, cut off the retreat of the troops south of it, and then crossed, almost unmolested, Little Folly Inlet?  
5th.
What works did the enemy construct on Little Folly Island up to July 10th?
What calibre and number of pieces did he put in position? 
6th.
How long did it take him from the time he broke ground until he opened fire? 
7th.
What was about his force then on Little Folly and Folly islands, and on board of transports? 
8th.
What were your forces of infantry in the district, and how distributed?
(See note A.) 
9th.
Could a better disposition have been made of them? 
10th.
What should have been the full force at each point for the proper defence of Morris, James, and Sullivan's islands?
(See note B.) 
11th.
Do our means of transportation, and other circumstances of tide and locality, admit a rapid concentration of force from one point to the other? 
12th.
Which of those three lines of approach was most vital to Charleston? 
13th.
Might not the enemy have intended a feint on Morris Island, and then a rapid concentration on James Island? 
14th.
How long would it have then required him to take possession or it?
And what would have been the result as to the safety of Charleston and its harbor, by establishing his batteries from Fort Johnson to Battery Glover? 
15th.
How could we have then maintained our communications with Sumter and Morris Island, his ironclads having command, meanwhile, of the outer harbor? 
16th.
Was it not a fortunate circumstance the enemy attacked Morris instead of James Island? 
17th.
From the apparent number of troops and vessels in North Edisto, about the 10th July last, was it not possible for the enemy to have concentrated his forces rapidly on James Island, and attempt to cross the Upper Stono, to march into St. Andrew's Parish? 
18th.
Was it not, then, necessary to guard also that line of approach? 
19th.
From the small force of infantry in the Second, Third, and Fourth Military Districts (see Note B), the difficulties and insufficiency of our means of transportation, could much assistance have been expected or derived from them? 
20th.
Were not the forces in the Second and Third Districts absolutely required where they were, to the last moment, to guard our important communication with Savannah? 
21st.
When did they get here, and how many? 
22d.
How much infantry force was in Georgia?
(See Note A.) 
23d.
How many came from there? 
24th.
When did they arrive? 
25th.
Did not, in your judgment, these Headquarters do all that our restricted means permitted to be done to afford you all the aid possible from other districts?
And, so far as you are aware, even from North Carolina, and from the Government itself, at Richmond?
(See my telegrams on the subject, if you desire.) 
26th.
Did not these Headquarters object most strenuously to the last in  sending troops, in April and May, to the State of Mississippi, stating the enemy's force was still too great in this Department, and such a depletion would endanger Charleston or Savannah, or their communications with each other? 
27th.
Did not the War Department insist, on the contrary, that the enemy's forces had been greatly reduced, if not mostly withdrawn, to attack Mobile, or reinforce Banks on the Mississippi River? 
28th.
Was not the truth of this information doubted, if not denied, at these Headquarters? 
29th.
Were not ample calls made during the last six months for negro labor to construct all the works required for the complete defence of Charleston? 
30th.
Were those calls answered satisfactorily? 
31st.
With those works completed and armed, and the troops we had then in this district, would not Charleston have been safe until reinforcements could have been sent from other points for its prolonged defence? 
32d.
Should it fall, will it not be due entirely, first, to the want of troops on the 10th July last, and then of labor? 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
N. B.—Battery Wagner was located by General Pemberton, and nearly finished when I arrived here, in September, 1862.
I strengthened it greatly by adding three heavy guns to its sea-face, where it had none; also, by traverses between its land guns, bomb-proofs, and closing its gorge, etc., etc. I then located and built Battery Gregg, at Cummings's Point, where I always intended, whenever practicable, to put a strong work, well armed, if the guns could be had. A good work southeast of Morris Island was also contemplated, with advanced rifle-pits, and a battery for a few field-guns, in embrasures, and well traversed. G. T. B. 
 Headquarters, First Mil. Dist., Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, August 29th, 1863. Brig.-Genl. Thomas Jordan, Chief of Staff, etc., etc., etc.: 
General,—In answer to the letter of General Beauregard of yesterday, I beg to say that I fear it will take more time than General Beauregard might desire for me to make a report which might be considered a full and detailed report of the circumstances which took place during the several months preceding the attack on Morris Island.
I will, however, proceed to answer his interrogations as fully as possible, and make up any deficiencies when time is allowed. 
To the 1st Question I would answer, that the presence of the enemy on Folly and Little Folly islands was known from the time that he landed, just before the attack of the 7th of April.
His movements were ascertained by means of observations from Long, Battery, Black, and Morris islands, and reported upon almost daily.
They consisted for some weeks in throwing up defensive works on Folly.
The force was variously estimated at from three to six regiments; and as his defensive operations progressed his works across the neck of Folly were plainly observed and reported upon.
They were about 3000 yards from Light-house Inlet.
To the 2d Question.—In the early part of March last the Commanding General, with me, visited Morris Island, and then determined and ordered the location of five guns—four shell-guns and one rifled 24-pounder — in detached batteries, to sweep the beach and crossing to Morris Island, from Little Folly.
Some time afterwards it was determined to locate a battery in the marsh at the mouth of Vincent's Creek, to flank Morris Island in front of Wagner.
It was also intended to place a battery on Black Island, to flank the crossing of Light-house Inlet. 
The battery at Vincent's Creek was to have two or three guns of long range.
A communication from James to Morris Island was also ordered. 
To the 3d Question I would state, that these operations being under the Engineer Department, and in no way under my charge, I can only give my opinions.
Some reasons why they were not completed were alluded to in my correspondence with the Headquarters of the Department of the 24th of May, 6th and 14th of June, and subsequently; but the prominent difficulties, as declared, was the want of labor and transportation. 
After the failure of the attack by ironclads on the 7th of April, and they had retired, the works could have been armed with a certain class of guns taken from the closed casemates of Fort Sumter.
Difficulties would have occurred with the carriages and ordnance stores.
These guns, however, would not have answered for what was required for the armament at the south end of Morris Island or Black Island.
Some guns reported to be of the class wished for having, as I understood, arrived from Europe at Wilmington, were asked for, and refused.
As the enemy persisted in his occupation, although the works were not completed at the south end of Morris Island, the armament was increased by a captured 30-pounder Parrott, a light Whitworth, and three 10-inch seacoast mortars.
It was, I have understood, intended to have constructed bombproof and hospital arrangements at the south end of Morris Island; but they had hardly been commenced. 
To the 4th Question.—In my opinion it would have been possible, had the works at the south end of the island been completed, and with the small force at our disposal, for the enemy by a bold dash from their ironclads and gunboats to have cut off the retreat of the troops south of Craig's Hill.
Nevertheless, as it was intended that the whole beach should be swept with grape, and the landing is quite difficult, it is, in my opinion, doubtful whether he would have undertaken so hazardous an enterprise.
He would probably have attempted to shell out the work at the south end directly; or, still more, so changed his point of attack; or, what is still more probable, had we been fully prepared, he never would have made it. 
To the 5th Question.—Up to the 8th or 9th of July the enemy, as far as could be ascertained, had constructed no works on Little Folly except to shelter his pickets from our shells.
An expedition had been organized to cross the inlet, drive in his pickets, and ascertain his works, as early as the 6th; but had been delayed by the weather and the character of our boats.
His works, such as they were, were discovered on the 9th, and a scouting expedition, under Captain Haskell, on the night of the 8th reported a fleet of boats moored as if in  readiness to attempt a crossing.
There is no doubt, from the character of the guns which he used—of which there were about thirty, of different calibres, from 30-pounder Parrotts down—that they had been placed on temporary platforms, behind the sand-hills for the most part.
Any shot heavier than a 30-pounder Parrott fired on the 10th came from the gunboats, or from the works on Big Folly. 
To the 6th Question.—The enemy was reported at work on the night of the 8th, and opened fire at about 5 o'clock on the morning of the 10th. 
To the 7th Question.—From the best sources of information the enemy's force consisted of four brigades, one of which landed on James Island, besides the fleet-probably in all, say, 10,000 men. 
To the 8th Question.—My force of infantry was in all 2462 effective: 1184 on James Island, 612 on Morris Island, and 204 on Sullivan's; and 462 in Charleston. 
To the 9th Question.—I do not know that a better disposition could have been made; for, had we concentrated on Morris Island, the enemy would at once have turned to James Island.
He might have gone to Sullivan's Island by way of Long Island, but having a foothold on James, and that being the most vital approach to Charleston, could he have taken our extended lines by a coup de main he would have selected that route.
The opportunity would have been given him, had we reduced the small force of infantry on that island.
Had I had the troops I should have thrown 2500 men on Morris Island to meet this attack.
These would have been about as many as could have been advantageously used, and is about the fullest strength the garrison has been increased to at any one time since the 10th of July. James Island, under the circumstances, ought— the enemy having a position upon it—to have been watched by from 3000 to 5000 infantry, besides the cavalry and artillery.
An estimate for defence must, of course, be made as against certain attacks, and while the enemy has transportation in abundance, with a powerful steam navy, both offensive and transport, while ours is deficient in both respects; and not sufficient for current service, he having the option which route to choose, we are compelled to guard all at once to such an extent as will prevent a complete surprise of some one of them.
These remarks will, I think, answer the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th interrogatories.
In answer to the 14th, 15th, and 16th, I think had we decreased our force on James Island by any number sufficient to have given positive strength to any other point, and the enemy had chosen and acted with as much éclat as he did at the south end of Morris Island, or at either of the two assaults on Battery Wagner, he could have penetrated our long, unguarded lines in a day, and obtained possession of the approaches to Charleston, which, if he chose to make use of them, would have at once cut off our communications with Morris Island and Fort Sumter.
I consider it fortunate, under all circumstances, that, situated as we were, the enemy chose the Morris Island route. 
To the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Questions I would answer, that there has been no time since the 15th of April that the enemy could not have thrown a force by the Edisto into St. Andrew's Parish, cutting our communications with Savannah, and threatening our city in that direction, rendering it necessary to  guard that approach, and also necessitating the retention of certain troops in that locality until the last moment, or until the enemy's attack had been fully developed.
The forces in the Second, Third, and Fourth Military Districts have always been small; but, small as they were, they fully employed our means of transport when they had to be removed with rapidity. 
To the 21st Question.—From the Second District, Nelson's battalion of 260 effectives arrived on the morning of the 10th July, and proceeded to Morris Island in time to reinforce the garrison after it had retreated to Battery Wagner.
The Marion Artillery, 4 guns and 39 effectives, arrived on the 12th, and was placed on James Island.
From the Third Military District a battalion of the 11th South Carolina Regiment, 400 effectives, arrived on the 12th of July, but soon had to return, to guard our communications with Savannah. 
The 22d, 23d, and 24th Questions cannot be answered.
According to my information there were 1795 effective infantry in Georgia.
Of these, 1430 effectives arrived in detachments on the 10th, 12th, and 13th of July. Colonel Olmstead's command, composed of detachments of the 1st, 12th, 18th, and 63d Georgia regiments, 534 effectives, arrived on the 10th, and proceeded at once to Morris Island, and assisted in the repulse of the attack on the morning of the 11th. 
To the 25th Question.—As soon as it was positively ascertained that the attack was imminent I believe that every available man was ordered to this point, and that requisitions were made for troops from North Carolina and other sources. 
I reported the matter and the necessities personally to the Headquarters of the Department, and took the orders for the quartermasters to provide transportation.
The troops reported to me as they came in, and were stationed without one moment's delay.
Up to the 9th of July there had been no other appearances to indicate the enemy's positive intentions than previously.
Nay, from intelligence received from Richmond, coupled with the incorrect accounts of the battle of Gettysburg, the cause of the arrival of transports in the Stono was questionable; and we knew not whether they brought troops or came to take those on Folly Island away.
I know that strenuous objections were urged against sending the troops in April or May last from this Department, while the enemy was in force in our front, and while it was contemplated to dislodge him from his position; and it is also within my knowledge that the War Department had the opinion that the enemy's force had been greatly reduced.
The truth of this opinion was questioned, and continued observations were made, resulting in the information that the enemy was still in our front in force— what, we had not the means of ascertaining, which could only be learned by the assistance of naval means.
The naval officers had been applied to, but could not co-operate, on account of the defective character of their ironclads, and they had no other vessels.
The above will answer the 26th, 27th, and 28th interrogatories. 
Calls were made through the State authorities for labor for months previous to the attack; but, this subject not being under my charge or control, I can only state that I have always understood that they were not responded to satisfactorily.
I know that the supply of labor was limited in the extreme, and the  weak garrisons were called on to supply certain deficiencies.
My observations on this point can best be learned by a reference to my correspondence concerning the preparation of Morris Island for defence, alluded to heretofore, commencing May 24th, and continued.
This is already at Department Headquarters. 
To the 31st Question.—I believe, had the works for the defence of Morris Island been completed and armed, that with the troops of my command, with small reinforcements, we could have held the southern extremity of Morris Island until larger had arrived from other points; and if no other method of attack had been attempted, the chances in my mind were that his whole attempt would have been repulsed.
As for the prolonged defence, I think it may be considered that the defence of our advanced works, Batteries Wagner and Gregg, and Fort Sumter, against two powerful assaults and open trenches of attack, armed with the most powerful modern artillery, for nearly fifty days, has been tolerably good already.
I hope it will be prolonged still further, and successfully.
Should Charleston fall, it certainly will be due to want of labor and troops; but the ultimate cause of an abridgment to the defence of Charleston is, in my mind, clearly attributable to the abandonment of Cole's Island.
This situation, far stronger by nature than Battery Wagner, and well fortified by art, with a far heavier armament, approachable only by water by the enemy, and then by his light-draught vessels, with two approaches by water and two by land in our hands, which could be garrisoned by two thousand men, nearly all of whom were provided with bomb-proof shelters, without an attack, or the slightest demonstration of one, was abandoned.
By this abandonment, against which I urged and advised in vain, the enemy obtained his point d'appui, and a convenient post, with the choice of two routes of attack—one by James and the other by Morris Island.
The first led directly to the city, the other to its outer defences.
The first was attempted, and was defeated by the gallantry of our troops at Secessionville, and the circumstance, somewhat fortuitous, and in nowise attributable to the commander who ordered the evacuation of Cole's Island, that the place was fortified, although some miles front that position.
The second attack has been attempted, and has progressed thus far with a fearful loss of life to the enemy, and a considerable loss of material and fortifications to us. The loss of the whole garrison at Cole's Island, and the position, would have advanced the enemy no further than he was at any time during the last fifteen months; and, as I have said, the chances of its defence were good.
Indeed, I believe it was stronger by itself than all the lines and works which have ever been projected for the defence of Charleston, and, if held, would have forced the enemy to make either a purely land or a purely naval attack, and these separated from each other by considerable distances.
We were tolerably well prepared for either.
Few men answered to repel the naval attack.
Our advanced positions and the nature of the country would have compelled the enemy to give us time for the concentration of troops to repel the other. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, R. S.  Ripley, Brig.-Genl. Comdg.  
 Headquarters, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., Nov. 4th, 1863. Flag-officer J. R. Tucker, Comdg. C. S. N. Forces afloat, Charleston, S. C.: 
Sir,—The Commanding General, having to visit James Island with the President this morning, requested me to enclose for your information Major Morris's telegram, which is believed to be reliable in Richmond. 
He directed me also to say that he hoped, in view of the possible contingency, it would suit your views to place one or two of your ironclads, at night, in position to fire between Fort Johnson and Cummings's Point, and between Fort Johnson and Battery Simkins, in case the latter work should be, unfortunately, carried. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff.

Immense loss of subsistence for armies and of property seems inevitable.
We need at least five thousand additional troops.
Have sent Governor Milton all I can spare without risking loss of Charleston or Savannah.
Cannot two brigades be ordered from Northwestern Georgia or North Carolina temporarily? G. T.  Beauregard. 
Telegram. Charleston, S. C., Feb. 11th, 1864:2 P. M. Genl. Samuel Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl., Richmond, Va.: 
General Finegan reports enemy about to attack him near Lake City.
Rapidity of movement indicates Tallahassee as the objective point—probably to form junction with forces from the Gulf.
I have ordered two and a half additional regiments and one light battery to Florida to prevent loss of that State, but have much weakened thereby Savannah and railroad to that city.
If one brigade could be sent here and another to Savannah, I would send immediately balance of Colquitt's troops to General Finegan.
A prompt answer is desirable, as well as for two general officers I applied for few days since. G. T.  Beauregard. 
Telegram. Charleston, S. C., Feb. 12th, 1864:11 A. M. Genl. Samuel Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl., Richmond, Va.: 
General Finegan's success yesterday was very creditable, enemy's force being much superior to his own; his reinforcements had not yet reached him, owing to delays on roads.
Losses not yet reported. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Charleston, S. C., May 18th, 1876. Mr. E. Willis: 
Dear Sir,—In answer to your request, and also that it will be a pleasure to do anything in my power for General Beauregard, to give my old general the particulars of the fish torpedo-boat that struck the Housatonic. After the evacuation I took the contract of removing all the Confederate wrecks and obstructions.
I claimed that the fish torpedo-boat was in my contract.
Professor Mallefeil claimed that it was in his contract, and that he had the contract of lifting all the United States wrecks that were in Charleston Harbor.
And I went to work to save the torpedo-boat, and I got on the top of her, and found out the cause of her sinking.
The boat is outside or alongside of the Housatonic. She can be lifted any time our people wish.
Mallefeil is bursted and out of the way. I have no more to say than that she can be saved, and my opinion is she is as good as the day she was sunk. 
Yours, truly, Angus  Smith, Sullivan's Island.  
 Charleston, S. C., May 18th, 1876. 
The fish-torpedo was brought by rail from Mobile.
The main feature in her construction was, she could be submerged and raised at pleasure, and had sufficient air pumped in to last her crew some hours.
After several trial-trips she was turned over to the navy, and a crew was placed on board.
While lying at the wharf at Fort Johnson, with the man-holes off, a steamer passed, and the waves from her wheel filled the boat.
The officer who was standing in the hatchway escaped, but the crew were unable to get out, and were all drowned.
She was raised, and a volunteer crew went on board and went down under the United States naval receiving-ship Mackinaw to experiment in placing a torpedo; by some derangement of her lifting power she did not come up, and was not recovered for eight or ten hours. It is supposed some eight or nine men were drowned in her. The officer who planned and had her built then came on from Mobile, and obtained a volunteer crew to go with him to blow up one of the United States vessels off the bar; he was successful in destroying the Housatonic, but again she remained submerged.
Whether she was sunk by one of the propeller blades, or the machinery again became deranged, no one knows.
I think the latter was the cause.
I have heard she has been found lying near the Housatonic, but cannot believe this, or she would have been raised, if only to rescue the bodies of the gallant fellows who went down in her. From Comr. D. N. Ingraham. 
Telegram. Charleston, S. C., Feb. 19th, 1864:7.30 P. M. Genl. Samuel Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl., Richmond, Va.: 
General Finegan reports ten regiments—at least one mounted—of enemy in his front.
Am reinforcing Finegan to utmost practicable extent.
It is essential to have them in immediate command of officer accustomed to handle troops in battle.
General Hill has not arrived or been heard from.
I propose to send General Taliaferro at once; he should be promoted—has earned it. I will go thither in due season.
Resources of that section too large and vital to be lost.
General Gilmer has been directed, as instructed, to repair at once to Mobile. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Charleston, S. C., S Feb. 26th, 1864. Genl. Samuel Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl., Richmond, Va.:

 Charleston, S. C., Feb. 26th, 1864. Major-Genl. J. Patton Anderson, Lake City, Fla.: 
Assume command of the forces in Florida.
Troops now en route will form another brigade, which, with Finegan's, will give a division to General Gardner, if he feels able to take the field.
I expect to be with you soon. G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg.  
 Charleston, S. C., Feb. 26th, 1864. Brig.-Genl. W. M. Gardner, Lake City, Fla.: 
Announce that War Department has sent to command the troops in Florida Major-General J. P. Anderson, and transfer the command to him. He will assign you to a division. G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
 Charleston, S. C., April 27th, 1864. Genl. S. Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl., Richmond, Va.: 
Prisoners report that it was the United States ship-of-war Housatonic, 12 guns, which was sunk in night of 17th instant by the submarine torpedo-boat, Lieutenant Dixon, of Alabama, commanding.
There is little hope of safety for that brave man and his associates, however, as they were not captured. G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. 
Report of General Joseph Finegan. Headquarters, District East Florida. In the field, twelve miles from Jacksonville, Feb. 26th, 1864. Brig.-Genl. Thomas Jordan, Chief of Staff, Charleston, S. C.: 
General,—For the information of the Commanding General I have the honor to report that on the evening of the 7th February the enemy landed at Jacksonville, from eighteen transports and gunboats, a large force of cavalry, artillery, and infantry, which was largely augmented by arrivals on the 8th instant. 
On the receipt of this intelligence I immediately notified Lieutenant-Colonel McCormick, commanding an effective force of near 350 men of all arms at Camp Finegan, to guard against a surprise, advising him that I would join the command as soon as I had issued the necessary orders for collecting my widely scattered troops, and despatched telegrams and letters for reinforcements.
On the 8th instant the enemy advanced from Jacksonville with great rapidity, in three heavy columns—cavalry in, the advance.
Artillery and infantry followed, under command of Brigadier-General Seymour.
They approached Camp Finegan as the command there was in the act of retiring. 
Their largely superior numbers deterred Lieutenant-Colonel McCormick, commanding, from attacking them, and in the darkness of the night he withdrew his command with caution and address, and joined me, at Camp Beauregard, near Ocean Pond, on the Olustee, on the 13th instant.
The enemy, with celerity pressed on to Baldwin, capturing on their way five guns of company A and B, Light Artillery, which had been ordered to Baldwin; reached Baldwin at daylight on the 9th instant.
Remaining a short time they continued on to Barber's the same night.
At this point they were met, on the 10th instant, by two companies of cavalry under Major Robert Harrison, 2d Florida Cavalry, whom I had ordered to join me, and who with much gallantry checked their progress for several hours at St. Mary's Crossing, with but small loss to us and a considerable loss to the enemy. 
On the 9th instant I removed all the Government stores from Sanderson, except fifteen hundred bushels corn, which was burned under my orders.
On the 10th the enemy reached Sanderson; on the 11th instant they were within three  miles of Lake City.
Here I had hastily collected, principally from the District of Middle Florida, a small force of 450 infantry, 110 cavalry, and two pieces of artillery.
On the night of the 10th I placed this force in a favorable position, two and a half milse from Lake City, in the direction of the enemy.
At halfpast nine the enemy advanced upon us with a force estimated to be 1400 mounted infantry and five pieces of artillery.
Here they opened upon us, fighting as infantry, and skirmished heavily with my advanced line.
Discovering my position and its strength, and probably presuming my force larger than it was, they retreated to Sanderson, thence to Barber's, on the east bank of the St. Mary's, where they constructed field-works, and concentrated their whole force for a final movement on Lake City. 
In the mean time I used every possible effort to gather reinforcements, and on the 13th moved to Ocean Pond, on Olustee, thirteen miles from Lake City, and occupied the only strong position between Lake City and Barber's. Here I had field-works thrown up, and for several days, with a force less than 2000 strong, awaited the enemy's advance. 
In this time my command was increased by the arrivals of reinforcements, and I organized the command as follows: the 6th, 19th, 23d, 27th, and 28th Georgia regiments, infantry, and 6th Florida battalion, infantry, as the first brigade, under the command of Brigadier-General Colquitt, with the Chatham Artillery (four guns) attached.
The 32d Georgia Volunteers, 1st Georgia Regulars, 64th Georgia Volunteers, 1st Florida battalion, and Bonaud's battalion, as the second brigade, under command of Colonel George P. Harrison, 32d Georgia Volunteers, with Guerard's light battery attached. 
The Florida Light Artillery being held in reserve, I assigned Colonel R. B. Thomas, Confederate States Army, to duty as Chief of Artillery, and organized the cavalry into a brigade, under the command of Colonel C. Smith, 2d Florida Cavalry, my whole effective force being as follows: infantry, 4600; cavalry, less than 600; artillery, three batteries, twelve guns. 
On the 20th instant the enemy advanced in three columns, since ascertained to have been twelve regiments of infantry (nine of white troops and three of black), estimated at 8000, and some artillery (number of guns unknown), and 1400 cavalry.
At 12 M. the enemy were within three miles of my position.
I ordered the cavalry, under Colonel C. Smith, 2d Florida Cavalry, supported by the 64th Georgia, Colonel Evans commanding, and two companies of 32d Georgia, to advance and skirmish with the enemy and draw them to our works.
The remaining force was placed under arms and prepared for action.
Apprehending that the enemy were too cautious to approach our works, I ordered General Colquitt, commanding first brigade, to advance with three of his regiments and a section of Gamble's artillery and assume command of the entire force, then ordered to the front, and feel the enemy by skirmishing, and, if he was not in too heavy force, to press him heavily.
I had personally instructed Colonel Smith, commanding cavalry, to fall back as soon as infantry advanced, and protect their flanks.
This movement was predicated on the information that the enemy had only three regiments of infantry, with some cavalry and artillery.
Perceiving that in this movement the force under Brigadier-General Colquitt's command might become too heavily engaged to withdraw without a large supporting force, and intending that if the enemy should prove to be in not too great strength to engage them, I ordered in quick succession, within the space of an hour, the whole command to advance to the front as a supporting force, and myself went upon the field.
These reinforcements were pushed rapidly forward, and, as I anticipated, reached the field at the moment when the line was most heavily pressed, and at a time when their presence gave confidence to our men and discouragement to the enemy.
I directed Lieutenant-Colonel Hopkins, commanding 1st Florida battalion, and Major Bonaud, commanding Bonaud's battalion, to fall into line on the left in the direction of the enemy's heaviest firing.
After I had ordered these reinforcements and they were some distance on the way to the front, and while I was myself on the way to the front, I received from Brigadier-General Colquitt, commanding in the front, a request for the reinforcements which had already been ordered.
The engagement became general very soon after its commencement.
The enemy were found in heavy force, their infantry drawn up in three supporting lines, their artillery in position, cavalry on their flanks and rear.
I ordered Brigadier-General Colquitt to press them with vigor, which he did with much judgment and gallantry.
They contested the ground stubbornly, and the battle lasted for four and a half hours. At the end of this time, the enemy's lines having been broken and re-formed several times, and two fine Napoleons and three 10-pounder Parrott guns, and one set of colors captured from them, they gave way entirely, and were closely pressed for three miles until nightfall.
I directed Brigadier-General Colquitt to continue the pursuit, intending to occupy Sanderson that night; but, in deference to his suggestion of the fatigue of the troops, the absence of rations, and the disadvantages of the pursuit in the dark, and in consequence of a report from an advance cavalry picket that the enemy had halted for the night and taken a position (which was subsequently ascertained to be incorrect), I withdrew the order.
During the continuance of the battle, also, after the enemy had given way, I sent repeated orders to Colonel Smith, commanding cavalry, to press the enemy on his flank, and to continue in the pursuit; but, through some misapprehension, these orders failed to be executed by him, and only two small companies on the left, and these but for a short distance, followed the enemy. 
The enemy retreated that night, hastily and in some confusion, to Sanderson, leaving a large number of their killed and wounded in our possession on the field.
Their loss in killed, both officers and men, was large; 418 of their wounded were removed by us from the field, and 400, or near that number, of their killed were buried by us; also nearly 200 prisoners were captured; several officers of high rank were killed, and others severely wounded.
Their loss cannot be less than 2000 or 2500 men, five superior guns, one set of colors captured, and 1600 stand of arms; also 130,000 rounds cartridges (damaged by having been thrown into water), as appears by the report of the ordnance officer herewith enclosed.
The victory was complete, and the enemy retired in rapid retreat, evacuating in quick succession Barber's and Baldwin, and falling back on Jacksonville.
 The enemy's forces were under command of Brigadier-General S. Seymour, who was present on the field.
The conduct of Brigadier-General Colquitt entitles him to high commendation.
He exhibited ability in the formation of his line, and gallantry in his advance on the enemy.
I have also to speak most favorably of Colonel George P. Garrison, commanding the second brigade, who exhibited in the engagement all the qualities of a capable and efficient officer.
Colonel R. B. Thomas, as Chief of Artillery, likewise rendered efficient service on the field.
Colonel Evans, commanding the 64th Georgia Volunteers, and Colonel Duncan L. Clinch, commanding the 4th Georgia Cavalry, were wounded while bravely performing their duty.
Lieutenant-Colonel Barron, of the 64th Georgia Volunteers, and Captain Camron, commanding, and Lieutenant Dancy, of the 1st Georgia Regulars; also Lieutenant Holland, commanding detachment from conscript camp—all officers of high promise—were killed.
Among the killed and wounded were many other officers and men who had distinguished themselves on other fields, for a detailed statement of whom, and for instances of individual merit, I refer to the reports of the brigade commanders. 
Our loss in the engagement was 93 killed, and 841 wounded—a large proportion very slightly.
In the opening of the engagement the cavalry, under command of Colonel Smith, skirmished with the enemy with spirit, and retired to the flanks, in obedience to their orders. 
On the 22d instant, having repaired the railroad, so as to secure my supplies, I advanced the command to Sanderson, pushing the cavalry rapidly in the direction of the enemy, and from Sanderson to Barber's, and thence to Baldwin and to this place, twelve miles from Jacksonville, where my farther progress was arrested by orders from Brigadier-General Gardner, who had been directed to assume command, by whom I was here, for the first time, officially notified that the command had been transferred. 
My efforts and those of my officers for the organization and concentration of a force adequate to meet the enemy's superior numbers, and to check them in their rapid advance, were incessant and arduous.
I have the gratification of reporting to the Commanding General that while I continued in command they were successful.
I transfer the army to my successor well supplied with forage and subsistence, well organized and armed, and deficient only in ordnance stores, for which timely requisitions were made, and which are now on their way. 
Very respectfully, Joseph  Finegan, Brig.-Genl. Comdg. 
Report of General Colquitt. Baldwin, Fla., Feb. 26th, 1864. Capt. Call, Asst. Adjt.-Genl.: 
Captain,—I have the honor to submit the following account of the engagement of the 20th instant, near Ocean Pond: 
Intelligence having been received of the approach of the enemy, I was instructed to take three regiments of my own brigade, with a section of Gamble's artillery, and proceed to the front, and assume command of all the forces which  had preceded me, consisting of two regiments of cavalry, under command of Colonel Smith, the 64th Georgia regiment, and two companies of the 32d Georgia regiment.
Subsequently other troops were sent forward, and I was directed to call for such reinforcements as might be needed. 
About two miles from Olustee Station I found the enemy advancing rapidly, and our cavalry retiring before them.
I then sent forward a party of skirmishers, and hastily formed line of battle, under a brisk fire from the enemy's advance.
The 19th Georgia was placed on the right, and the 28th Georgia on the left, with a section of Captain Gamble's artillery in the centre.
The 64th Georgia and the two companies of the 32d Georgia were formed on the left of the 28th, and the 6th Georgia regiment was sent still farther to the left, to prevent a flank movement of the enemy in that direction. 
Instructions were sent to Colonel Smith, commanding cavalry, to place his regiments on the extreme flank, and to guard against any movement of the enemy from either side. 
The line of infantry was then ordered to advance, which was gallantly done, the enemy contesting the ground, and giving way slowly.
Perceiving that the enemy were in strong force, I sent back for reinforcements and a fresh supply of ammunition.
The 6th Florida battalion and 23d Georgia regiment soon arrived for my support.
The 6th Florida battalion was formed on the right of the 19th Georgia, and in such position as to come in on the left flank of the enemy.
The 23d Georgia was put on the left of the 64th Georgia. Colonel Harrison, coming up with the 32d and 1st Georgia Regulars, took position on the left, between the 23d and 6th Georgia regiments, and was instructed to assume the general direction of the left of the line. 
The section of Gamble's artillery in the centre having been disabled by the loss of horses and limber, Captain Wheaton, who had early arrived upon the field with the Chatham Artillery, and had taken position on the right, was ordered to the centre to relieve Captain Gamble.
This battery moved forward and took position under a heavy fire, and continued to advance with the line of infantry until the close of the action.
Towards night, when Captain Wheaton's ammunition was almost expended, a section of Ginrood's battery, of Harrison's brigade, under Lieutenant Gignilleat, moved up and opened fire on the enemy, furnishing Captain Wheaton with part of his ammunition. 
After our line had advanced about one-quarter of a mile the engagement became general, and the ground was stubbornly contested.
With two batteries of artillery immediately in our front, and a long line of infantry, strongly supported, the enemy stood their ground for some time, until the 6th Florida battalion, on the right flank, and all the troops in front, pressing steadily forward, compelled them to fall back and leave five pieces of artillery in our possession.
At this time, our ammunition beginning to fail, I ordered the commanding officers to halt their regiments and hold their respective positions until a fresh supply could be brought from the ordnance-wagons, which, after much delay, had arrived upon the field. 
Major Bonaud's battalion came upon the field, followed soon after by the 27th Georgia regiment and the 1st Florida battalion.
These troops were put in  position near the centre of the line, and a little in advance, to hold the enemy in check until the other command could be supplied with cartridges.
As soon as this was accomplished I ordered a general advance, at the same time sending instructions to Colonel Harrison to move the 6th and 32d Georgia regiments (arrived) on the right flank of the enemy.
The 27th Georgia regiment, under Colonel Zackry, pushing forward with great vigor upon the centre, and the whole line moving as directed, the enemy gave way in confusion.
We continued the pursuit for several miles, when night put an end to the conflict.
Instructions were given to the cavalry to follow close upon the enemy, and seize every opportunity to strike a favorable blow. 
The results of the engagement in the killed, wounded, and prisoners of the enemy, and our own loss, will be found in the reports rendered directly to you. 
The gallantry and steady courage of officers and men during this engagement are beyond all praise.
For more than four hours they struggled with unflinching firmness against superior numbers, until they drove them in confusion and panic to seek safety in flight. 
Colonel George P. Harrison, who commanded on the left, displayed skill, coolness, and gallantry.
The commanding officers of the various regiments did their duty nobly.
Colonel Evans, commanding the 64th Georgia, and Captain Crawford, commanding the 28th Georgia, both gallant officers, were wounded.
Lieutenant-Colonel Barrow, of the 64th Georgia, a brave and gallant officer, received a fatal shot while gallantly attempting to rally his men. Captain Wheaton, and the officers and men of his battery, are entitled to special commendation for their courage, coolness, and efficiency. 
Captain Grattan, Assistant Adjutant-General; Lieutenant Colquitt, Assistant Department Commander; Major Ely, and Lieutenant Estill, of my staff, were active and conspicuous in every part of the field.
My thanks are due to Lieutenant Thompson, 2d Florida regiment, and Mr. Sterling Turner, volunteer aids, for their gallant service.
The names of those in the ranks entitled to be particularly mentioned may be furnished in a subsequent report. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, A. H.  Colquitt, Brig.-Genl. 
 Charleston, S. C., March 1st, 1864. General Samuel Cooper, A. and Ins.-Genl., Richmond, Va.: 
General Beauregard left 28th ultimo for Florida. General Gardner, in command there, reports that General Gillmore is now in chief command; that he is being reinforced; has retired to Jacksonville, which he is fortifying; but appearances all indicate another attempt to advance in heavier force soon.
Large number of transports reported at St. John's Bar with troops.
We occupy Baldwin. Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff. 
Telegram. Charleston, S. C., March 19th, 1864. General G. T. Beauregard, Baldwin, Fla.: 
I telegraphed you last night of orders received from Richmond of sweeping  away four regiments and eight companies of cavalry from your Department.
It will be needless to apply then for delay of Miller's battalions.
Some prominent Carolinians will interpose; but I doubt their success. Thomas  Jordan, Chief of Staff.  
Battle of Ocean Pond, Florida. 
Report of General Beauregard. Headquarteris, Department S. C., Ga., and Fla., Charleston, S. C., March 25th, 1864. To General Samuel Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl., C. S. A., Richmond, Va.: 
General,—In transmitting detailed reports of recent operations in East Florida I have to accompany them, for the information of the War Department, with the following. 
The officer in observation at Foot Point of the enemy's fleet in the waters of Port Royal and Broad River having reported, on the afternoon of the 14th of January, that some thirty-five vessels, including an ironclad from Hilton Head, had gone to sea in the fog the day before, and probably with troops, as it was observed to be more quiet on the adjacent islands (less drumming and firing of small-arms) than usual, I gave Major-General Gilmer, at Savannah, immediate notification of the fact, with instructions to keep strict watch in the direction of Warsaw Sound and the Ossabaw.
At the same time orders were given to the proper staff-officers to hold means of transportation by rail in readiness on the Charleston and Savannah Railroad.
An increase of the tents of the enemy on Tybee Island was also reported.
On the 16th of January I repaired in person to Savannah, in which quarter I apprehended some operations might be looked for. I remained in the District of Georgia, inspecting the troops and works, until the 3d of February, when, there being no indication of any movement of the enemy in that direction, I returned to Charleston, leaving with Major-General Gilmer orders to hold the 64th Georgia Volunteers, the 1st Florida battalion, and a light battery in readiness to be sent to Florida at short notice. * * * 
General D. H. Hill having arrived at these Headquarters on the 28th ultimo, I left for Florida the same evening, although that officer was unwilling, for personal reasons, to assume the duty at once I had desired to intrust to him—the immediate command of the troops in the State of South Carolina; but he promised to repair to any point threatened or attacked by the enemy, and give the officer there in command the benefit of his experience and assistance. 
On the 2d instant I reached Camp Milton, General Gardner's headquarters, in rear of McGirt's Creek, twelve or thirteen miles distant from Jacksonville, where I found our troops in position.
The day preceding our advanced pickets had been thrown forward to Cedar Creek, within six or seven miles of Jacksonville.
On the 3d Major-General J. Patton Anderson also arrived at Camp Milton, and assumed command on the 6th instant of the forces, now about eight thousand effectives of all arms. 
In the mean time it had been ascertained from reliable sources that the enemy occupied Jacksonville with at least twelve thousand men; that the position,  naturally strong, had been much strengthened since the battle of the 20th ultimo, and that four or five gunboats in the St. John's effectually commanded the approaches to the place.
Under these circumstances it was determined not to attempt to carry the position by assault, as, in effect, instructed by your telegram of the 4th instant.
Everything indicates that the rout of the enemy at Ocean Pond or Olustee was complete; nevertheless, the fruits of the victory were comparatively insignificant, and mainly because of the inefficiency of the officer commanding the cavalry at the time, in consequence of whose lack of energy and capacity for the service no serious attempt was made to pursue with his command; while the exhaustion of the infantry, so gallantly and efficiently handled and engaged, and our want of subsistence, supplies, and ammunition, made an immediate pursuit by them impracticable. 
Unless our present forces should be considerably increased, and amply supplied with means for a regular siege of Jacksonville, our operations in that quarter must be confined to the defensive; that is, to preventing the penetration of the enemy into the interior, either on the line towards Lake City or into the lower part of the State; to which end a position has been selected on the St. John's a few miles above Jacksonville for a battery of one rifled 32-pounder, three rifled 30, and one 20 and one 10 pounder Parrott, and two 8-inch siege howitzers, by which, with torpedoes in the river, it is expected transports at least can be obstructed from passing with troops beyond Jacksonville. 
Cavalry pickets have been also established for the protection of the railroad to Cedar Keys from injury by raiding parties set on foot from the west bank of the St. John's. 
I have for the present organized the force under General Anderson into three brigades, commanded, respectively, by Brigadier-Generals Finegan and Colquitt and Colonel George P. Harrison—three meritorious officers, the last two of whom have won promotion by their active participation in the combat of the 20th ultimo, at which, it is proper to say, Brigadier-General Colquitt commanded on the immediate field of battle.
He has seen much service likewise in the Army of Northern Virginia. 
The cavalry has also been organized into a brigade, under Colonel Robert H. Anderson; the four light batteries, of four pieces each, were placed under command of Lieut.-Colonel C. C. Jones, and two batteries of siege-guns (six pieces), present on the field, under Major J. L. Buist.
It is hoped this arrangement will enhance the efficiency of the troops, who are in fine spirits and good condition. 
Too much praise cannot be awarded to the brave officers and men who encountered and defeated twice their numbers at Ocean Pond, and I commend them to the notice of the Government; they are in all respects worthy comrades of those who, on other fields, have done honor to Southern manhood. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg.

Memoranda for General Bragg. Weldon, N. C., April 23d, 1864. 
Supposing this Department was to form a part of my former Department, I brought with me, or ordered to report to me here (before leaving Charleston), without further reference to the War Department, the following officers, who, I hope, will be allowed to remain with me: 
Officers brought with me. 
Captains John M. Otey and Alb. Ferry, Assistant Adjutant-Generals. 
Officers ordered here. 
Colonel D. B. Harris, Engineer; Majors Henry Bryan and Giles B. Cook, Assistant Adjutant-Generals, as inspectors.
Offcers Required to Complete my General Staff. 
1. Chief of Staff. 
Brigadier-General Thomas Jordan, if his services can be obtained; otherwise, Colonel G. W. Brent, or Major S. W. Melton, or Colonel George Williamson, who was assistant adjutant-general to General Polk at Corinth. 
2. Chief of Artillery. 
Lieutenant-Colonel C. C. Jones, now Chief of Artillery to General Mercer for the District of Georgia. 
3. Chief of Ordnance. 
Lieutenant-Colonel J. R. Waddy, now Chief of Ordnance, Department South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, as soon as he can be spared; if he cannot, then Captain James Harding, in charge of a cap-factory near Savannah, or any good ordnance officer (of General Bragg's choice) who is intelligent, energetic, and prompt, and has system and order. 
Lieutenant Edmund Mazyck, as assistant ordnance officer, now Chief of Ordnance to Brigadier-General Hagood, on James Island, Department South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.

Remarks. 
I consider Colonel Roman and Dr. Brodie as indispensable.
I should like to have them ordered to report to me as soon as they can be spared from their present duties. 
Lieutenant-Colonel Roman is fully deserving of promotion to the rank of colonel; he commanded with distinction the 18th Louisiana regiment at Shiloh, and has done excellent service in the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, since he reported there in October, 1862. 
Major Henry Bryan is also a most meritorious officer-zealous, intelligent, and brave, he is one of the most vigilant and searching inspectors I have yet seen; nothing escapes his notice.
He was wounded in Virginia, while assistant adjutant-general to Major-General Magruder. 
Captain Otey is one of the best assistant adjutant-generals in the serviceprompt, energetic, intelligent, zealous, methodic, and indefatigable in the discharge of his arduous duties.
He has been one of my assistant adjutantgen-erals since Manassas, and should be made at least lieutenant-colonel.
He is in charge of my office as assistant adjutant-general. G. T.  Beauregard.

 Headquarters, Department N. C. And so. Va., Weldon, N. C., April 25th, 1864. 
Geneal,—In view of the great uncertainty still prevailing as to the point in this Department to which Burnside's expedition may be suddenly directed, I consider it my duty to call your attention to the present scattered condition of the only available troops at my command to oppose such an attack. 
The temporary displacement of troops from their defensive positions for the support of General Hoke's expedition against Washington and Newbern was ordered by you, under the supposition that, with the assistance of the ironclad gunboat in the Roanoke and the one in the Neuse rivers, those two fortified positions would be taken by a rapid movement and a sudden attack; but already several days have elapsed since the fall of Plymouth, and, through various insurmountable obstacles, neither Washington nor Newbern have been attacked; moreover, General Corse from Kinston reports that the ironclad gunboat in the Neuse is hard aground, with the water falling rapidly.
It is, then, probable that the contemplated expedition will require at least one week to be brought to a conclusion.
Meanwhile, Burnside's movement on Petersburg or this place (Weldon), if made suddenly, would meet with but little resistance; and the communications of the forces in Virginia with the States of South Carolina and Georgia, whence they draw their principal supplies, could be effectually cut off at almost any moment. 
Major-General Pickett has now at his command in his military district, for the protection of Petersburg, only about two thousand men of all arms.
At this important point (Weldon) there is only one regiment (three hundred and fifty men) of State troops, under Colonel Hinton.
At Goldsboroa there are only two hundred men of all arms; and in Wilmington, for its defence and to guard its approaches, only two regiments of Martin's and Evans's brigades. 
The other movable troops of the Department are about as follows: sixteen regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and twenty-five pieces of artillery, amounting, in all, to about six thousand men, under Brigadier-General Hoke, now on the march from Plymouth to attack Washington. 
Three regiments of Martin's brigade are at Plymouth and Harrellsville. 
Two regiments of Evans's brigade and a section of light artillery, to guard prisoners taken at Plymouth, are at Tarboroa. 
Five regiments of Corse's brigade, two regiments of Evans's brigade, seven companies of cavalry, twenty-five pieces of artillery are at Kinston, under Brigadier-General Walker, to support Hoke's attack on Newbern.
By the enclosed table of distances between the principal points in this Department it will be seen the utter impossibility of concentrating in time these troops for the defence of Petersburg, Weldon, or Wilmington, if suddenly attacked by a determined enemy. 
I submit the above facts to your consideration in order that I may receive, as soon as practicable, the definite views of the Department on this important subject. 
Having only just arrived in this Department, and not having yet received returns of the forces in it, I may have committed some errors in the number of  available troops, which cannot be, however, sufficiently great to affect the general conclusions arrived at. 
From an experience of over eighteen months in the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida I beg to submit the following general views for the proper organization of this Department.
To insure its successful defence with the smallest available force it should be divided into three military districts (instead of two), each one under a competent major-general. 
The first district, under Major-General Pickett, to extend from the James River to the Roanoke, with his headquarters at Petersburg, or wherever his presence may be most required in his district. 
The second district to extend from the Roanoke to the Neuse River, with its headquarters at Tarboroa, Greenville, or Kinston, as circumstances shall dictate. 
The third district, from the Neuse to Cape Fear, under Major-General W. H. C. Whiting, with his headquarters at Wilmington, or such other point of the district as circumstances may require. 
Each of these districts should be divided by their commanders (subject to my approval) into subdistricts, according to the topographical defensive features of each district.
These subdistricts should be divided (when necessary) by the district commanders into military sections, subject also to my approval.
These subdistricts and sections must be commanded by the ranking officers of the troops therein located. 
By this system it is apparent that each commanding officer of a district, subdistrict, or section would be enabled to make himself thoroughly acquainted with all the roads, rivers, fords, and general defensive features of the portion of country placed under his immediate charge, and would be prepared to make the best disposition of his troops to hold the enemy in check until reinforcements could be received, which, from his thorough knowledge of the country, could be used immediately to the best advantage. 
Moreover, the adoption of this system would enable me to transfer suddenly my headquarters from one district to another, according to the emergency of the case, without interfering with the working of the system.
It was the one I proposed introducing in my late Department, each State representing a district, under a major-general, but I was unable to carry it fully into effect, through the want of a proper commanding officer to each district. 
Should the Department have no disposable major-general competent to command the second military district recommended in this communication, I would be pleased to have promoted and ordered to report to me for that duty Brigadier-General Taliaferro, who so highly distinguished himself in the defence of Morris Island, especially of Battery Wagner, on the 18th of July, 1863.
He has, moreover, during the whole siege of Charleston, commanded the District of James Island, where he has displayed great zeal, energy, and intelligence.
He is, besides, thoroughly acquainted with the system of district commands as organized in the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. 
I may be permitted here to call to your attention that none of the officers recommended for promotion for gallantry and meritorious services, during the memorable siege of Charleston, have yet been promoted, except Lieutenant- Colonel Elliott, P. A. C. S. Arty., Colonel D. B. Harris and Captain John Johnson, of the Engineers—three officers who are fully entitled, by their zeal, bravery, and intrepidity, to further promotion. 
In conclusion, I must be permitted to give, although just entering on my duties, what I consider the smallest movable force of all arms required (until reinforcements could be obtained) to protect this Department against the attack of an enterprising and determined enemy, to wit: 
In the First Military District, infantry, cavalry, and light artillery, about10,000 
 Second 8,000 
 Third 5,000

Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. Genl. Braxton Bragg, Commander-in-Chief, Richmond, Va. 
P. S.—Since the above was written I am informed that Brigadier-General Hoke has been promoted to the rank of major-general for his gallant attack on Plymouth.
He would, no doubt, be a good commander for the proposed Second Military District of this Department. G. T. B. 
Telegram. Weldon, N. C., April 29th, 1864:3.45 P. M. Genl. Pickett, Petersburg, Va.: 
Order General Clingman to make a reconnoissance, with one strong regiment of infantry, three or four companies of cavalry, and a battery, in the direction of Suffolk and Portsmouth, with a view of obtaining positive information of the enemy's movements and intentions.
He must be absent few days, for his services may be required soon. G. T.  Beauregard. 
Telegram. Kinston, N. C., May 1st, 1864. Genl. Braxton Bragg, Commanding Richmond, Va.: 
Gunboat in Neuse hopelessly aground or useless until river rises.
Albemarle still at Plymouth.
With its assistance I consider capture of Newbern easy.
Without it sacrifice of life must be very great, unless regular approaches are resorted to. I will leave General Hoke, however, to carry out his instructions, and will afford him all the aid and advice in my power. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Headquarters, Department N. C. and So. Va., Kinston, N. C., May 1st, 1864. 
General,—Having no authority to interfere in your proposed movement on Newbern, your instructions having been received direct from General Bragg, I avail myself of your desire that I should command the expedition to offer you the following suggestions, resulting from information received or collected since my arrival here. 
It appears that the enemy's forces (reported to be about six thousand men of all arms) in and around Newbern are distributed nearly as follows:  
1st. One regiment of infantry and one of cavalry occupy the outer line of works about seven miles from Newbern, and guard the direct approaches to that town. 
2d. Three regiments of infantry and several companies of heavy artillery occupy the forts and lines defending the town. 
3d. Three regiments defend the works on the south side of the Trent. 
4th. Two regiments occupy those on the north side of the Neuse. 
There are three methods of attacking Newbern: first, by surprise and assault; second, by assault without surprise; third, by regular approaches. 
The first and last methods are impracticable at present; for the enemy must be aware of your intentions, and we have not sufficient time to execute the last.
The second plan is, therefore, the only one which can now be carried into effect; it can, however, be made to partake more or less of a surprise, and, with the assistance of the ironclad gunboat Albemarle, from Plymouth, should meet with complete success.
I regret to say that no hope need be entertained of the cooperation of the ironclad gunboat now aground in the Neuse, near this place; for it is not probable it can be got afloat again, or be made to pass over the bars and sand-banks below its present position, without a considerable rise in the river, an event which is not likely to take place until the next rainy season. 
The attack on Newbern should be so made as to capture or destroy the separate forces of the enemy before they can be concentrated; for that purpose the Albemarle, immediately after having sunken the two or three wooden gunboats aiding in the defence of the town, should destroy the long bridge across the Trent, so as to isolate the troops now stationed on its south side; the Albemarle should then take such a position in the Neuse as to cut off from Newbern the communications of the forces on the north side of that river, and it should also co-operate with General Hoke's attack, by taking in flank and rear the works and lines extending from the Neuse to the Trent, defending the direct approaches to the city. 
The land operations should be conducted as follows, subject to such modifications as future information may develop: 
1st. One regiment of cavalry, supported by two regiments of infantry and one light battery, should be sent, by the best and safest route, to cut off, about Croatan, the railroad from Newbern to Morehead City, and prevent reinforcements being thrown from the latter to the former, or the retreat of the garrison from Newbern to Morehead City. 
2d.
A strong demonstration should be made in front of the enemy's advanced lines on Batchelor Creek, about seven miles from Newbern, to hold in position the forces there stationed until the main body of General Hoke's troops shall have got to their rear, about half-way between that creek and the town of Newbern. 
The best route to be followed by General Hoke's main column seems to be the Trenton road (south of Trenton River) as far as the nearest cross-road to Tar Landing, or Rock Landing, on the Trent, where this river must be crossed on a pontoon-bridge, hastily constructed; from this point the Trent road must be reached by the shortest route and followed until coming to the Savannah  road, near James Branch or Creek.
The column will then move along the Savannah road until reaching the Neuse road from Kinston to Newbern, where it will take up its position, throwing forward some cavalry and light troops to threaten Newbern and guard the roads leading out of that town. 
A proper force should be left to guard the crossings of James Branch, by the Trent and Savannah roads, in order to prevent a part of the enemy's troops occupying the advanced lines from retreating into Newbern. 
A small force of cavalry, with a section of artillery, should be thrown towards Clermont bridge, on the Trent, to prevent the troops from the south side of the Trent from getting into Newbern after the destruction of the long bridge by the Albemarle. 
3d. General Hoke will then throw forward a sufficient force from his main body to attack in rear the enemy's advanced lines, already referred to, along Batchelor Creek, and from thence to the Trent.
General Hoke's troops left on the west side of Batchelor Creek should attack also with vigor as soon as they shall have heard the firing in their front. 
4th.
A rapid reconnoissance should determine, meanwhile, where and how to attack the line of works constructed near the town from the Neuse to the Trent.
It is probable that the portion of the line nearest to the former stream will be found the least difficult to take, especially with the co-operation of the Albemarle operating in the Neuse. 
Circumstances may be such, however, as to render it advisable to attack the works on the south side of the Trent, and afterwards (or perhaps at the same time) the forts on the north side of the Neuse, so as to isolate more completely the garrison of the town, which, reduced and demoralized by these repeated losses, might gladly surrender without prolonging further a useless struggle which might terminate so fatally to them, especially if made fully to understand the dangers of further resistance. 
Should the forces on the south side of the Trent endeavor to retreat to Morehead City, they should be pursued vigorously until checked by the troops already thrown towards Croatan, near Otter Creek, to intercept their retreat in that direction. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg. Major.-Genl. R. F. Hoke, Comdg. expedition against Newbern. 
P. S.—It is important to diminish as far as practicable the artillery fire of the enemy's work; hence the faces of all the forts and batteries bearing in the direction of the points of attack should be prolonged, and field rifled pieces put in position to enfilade them at long range just as the attack shall have commenced.
Two pieces to each face would probably be sufficient. G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. Comdg.

Am making best arrangements practicable to oppose them; but most of the cavalry of this Department is still with General Hoke, whose forces will only commence arriving to-night at Kinston.
Half of Wise's brigade is expected here in a few hours, on its way to Petersburg.
Hagood's last detachment passed here last night. G. T.  Beauregard. 
In General Hagood's Memoirs of the Campaign of 1864—a certified copy of which is among General Beauregard's files—we find the following paragraphs: 
Hagood's brigade commenced moving by rail on the night of the 28th April for Wilmington, where it was directed to report by letter to General Beauregard, whose headquarters were at Weldon.
The whole brigade, with its transportation, was not concentrated at Wilmington till the 4th May. * * * On the 5th May the brigade received orders to proceed by rail to Petersburg, its train to move by highway.
Owing to insufficient transportation it moved in fragments.
Lieutenant-Colonel Dargan was despatched, with seven companies of the 21st, on the 5th, early in the day. He was followed by Colonel Graham, with the remaining companies of that regiment and three companies of the 25th.
Next day (the 6th) General Hagood moved with the 27th regiment and the remaining companies of the 25th.
Later in the day the 11th regiment and 7th battalion followed. * * * 
The City of Richmond was Grant's objective, and he proposed to move upon it by the direct overland route; while Butler, moving from Fortress Monroe up the James, was to secure a point at its junction with the Appomattox, from which to operate on the southern communication of Richmond. * * * To sap the Confederate sources of material supply, razzias by light movable columns, for the purpose of destroying railroads, mills, provisions, growing crops, farm stock, and buildings, were to be speedily organized. * * * The move from Fortress Monroe was the most important and threatening diversion in the programme of the Virginia campaign; and, with thirty or forty thousand men and  a large naval armament, was intrusted to General B. F. Butler, of New Orleans notoriety. * * * 
On the night of the 5th Butler debarked at Bermuda Hundreds, the peninsula made by the confluence of the James and the Appomattox, and began to intrench across the narrow neck, about three miles from the railroad connecting Petersburg and Richmond.
On the 6th he threw out a brigade to destroy the railroad at Walthall Junction.
Beauregard's troops were much scattered over his extensive territorial command, pending the development of the enemy's designs. * * * Very few, if any, troops other than local militia of an inferior character were under General Pickett, commanding at Petersburg; and it was to meet and delay Butler's advance that Hagood's brigade had been pushed forward while Beauregard got the balance of his troops in hand, and drew reinforcements from farther south. 
Colonel Graham, of Hagood's brigade, with the companies he had moved with, arrived at Petersburg, and was pushed forward by General Pickett to Walthall Junction, reaching the latter place a little before 5 P. M. on the 6th May, and there found Lieutenant-Colonel Dargan's detachment, which had preceded him about an hour.
This raised his force to about 600 men, composed of his own regiment and three companies of the 25th, under Major Glover.
As Graham's men jumped off the platform-cars upon which they were borne, the brigade of the enemy, before alluded to as thrown forward against the railroad, was in view, some thousand yards off, across an open field, advancing in line of battle, and supported by artillery. * * * A brisk action ensued.
The enemy made two direct attacks, and, after his second repulse, at nightfall withdrew, leaving some of his dead and wounded upon the field. * * * 
At 8 P. M. the same evening General Hagood arrived at Petersburg with the remaining seven companies of the 25th, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Pressley.
After some delay in rationing the men, he moved forward to reinforce Graham. * * * Arrived at the Junction, General Hagood found General Bushrod Johnson there, who informed him that, hearing Graham's firing, he had marched to his assistance from the direction of Drury's Bluff with a brigade of 1168 Tennesseeans, and had arrived during the night.
Galliard, with the 27th regiment, joined Hagood at daybreak, and raised his command to an aggregate of 1500 men. * * * 
About 10 A. M. General Hagood was directed to move across Ashton Creek towards the church, to feel and develop the strength and position of the enemy. * * * The skirmishers encountered the enemy's cavalry advancing, and fired upon them, driving them back.
The 27th was at once deployed to the right of the road, and the skirmish line strengthened. * * * The enemy showing a disposition to develop to our left, the 25th regiment was deployed on the line of the 29th and to the left of the road. * * * General Hagood was directed to withdraw and take position along the railroad at the Junction. * * * It was evident that an attack in force was now about to be made.
Our line was formed along the railroad, with Ha good's left resting where the turnpike crossed it, and Johnson's men prolonging the right towards and beyond Craig's house. * * * After a halfhour's brisk fighting the enemy retired his line somewhat, though still engaging  us at long range, and, under cover of an immediate wood, moved his second line by a flank across the railroad, and it soon reappeared approaching upon Hagood's left and rear, the left of this force being upon the prolongation of our line of battle. * * * 
As soon as his new line was taken General Hagood ordered an advance.
The brigade rushed forward with enthusiasm, and drove back the flanking line —they not again appearing in that direction. * * * The enemy again massed heavily in Hagood's front and essayed an advance; but his men, sheltered in the railroad-cut, easily repelled this attack, with little loss to themselves.
Between 4 and 5 o'clock P. M. the engagement ceased, except the firing of sharpshooters and artillery on both sides; and before dark the enemy withdrew from the field, unpursued, and carrying off most of his wounded.
Hagood's force, as before stated, was 1500 men, and his loss during the day was 22 killed, 132 wounded, and 13 missing. The force of the enemy was five brigades of infantry, under General Brooks, with the usual proportion of artillery, and a regiment of cavalry.
His loss was heavy, * * * estimated at 1000.
Prisoners put it larger.
It was probably not as great. * * * The brunt of this action fell upon Hagood's brigade; and in the progress of the narrative it will be seen that it saved Petersburg.
By the time the enemy were again ready to advance sufficient reinforcements had arrived to hold the place.
The citizens appreciated the fact, and were enthusiastic in their gratitude.
A flag was voted the brigade by the ladies.
The merchants would take no pay from the men for their little purchases, and from at least one pulpit thanks were offered for the timely arrival of the 1500 brave South Carolinians.
The brigade did acquit itself well.
It was its first fight upon Virginia soil, and a creditable letter of introduction to the battle-scarred veterans of Lee, among whom it was shortly merged. * * *

He commenced moving this morning to clear his front of enemy and form junction with Major-General Ransom; but, having been informed after movement had been ordered that enemy had retired to Bermuda Hundreds, I ordered General Hoke to make forced reconnoissance in that direction to ascertain fact, and press on enemy, if he were re-embarking, when I would join him, to assume command, if necessary.
About noon to-day the spirit of this order was objected to by Secretary of War, and consequently countermanded by me. An immediate junction with Ransom was ordered; but two hours afterwards the order to make forced reconnoissance was approved by General Bragg, and is now being executed.
Please see plan of this movement. 
Enemy is now constructing works on north side of the Appomattox, and occupying threatening attitude in that direction.
Please inform me if my course is approved by you. G. T.  Beauregard. 
Telegram. Petersburg, May 12th, 1864. To Genl. Beauregard: 
Your better knowledge of circumstances enables you better to judge the proper time for departure.
The order for a forced reconnoissance, under the condition stated, seems to me entirely appropriate.
The operations of General Ransom and events on this side have changed the state of affairs, as will be communicated you. We are now engaged with the enemy before Richmond.
I will send fuller despatch when I return from the field. Jeffn. Davis.

An order from Secretary of War has just been sent to you by a courier extending your command to include the south side of James River, including Drury's Bluff and its defences. T.  Rowland, A. A. G. 
Telegram. Richmond, Va., May 14th, 1864:8 A. M. Genl. G. T. Beauregard: 
You are assigned to the command south of the James River.
It is also expected that you will meet any sudden move of the enemy against the city on the north side.
Should they cross the river below you I shall immediately send you all the assistance in our power, and you will take the offensive at once.
We can draw nothing from above, and our information is that reinforcements will reach the enemy in your front.
If you can dislodge him from the Petersburg road, some additional force may reach you from there.
The cavalry should certainly come through.
Our communications must be restored. Braxton  Bragg. 
 Richmond, Va., January 2d, 1882. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, New Orleans, La.: 
My dear General,—* * * Your impression is undoubtedly correct that you sent me, on the day prior to your engagement at Drury's Bluff, to General Whiting with a copy of your order of battle and special written instructions to him to advance directly towards Drury's Bluff and attack Butler, while you were attacking him in front.
I recollect distinctly your emphasizing verbally to me your instructions that he was to march towards the sound of your guns and attack whatever forces he might meet, without regard to their numbers.
In response to your request I take great pleasure in giving you a short narrative of my mission in this connection the week preceding and on the day of the battle of Drury's Bluff. 
In the spring of 1864 the Hampton Legion, of which I was LieutenantColo-nel, had been ordered to South Carolina, to procure horses, with a view of being assigned as mounted infantry to a brigade which was then being organized for special service around Richmond. * * * 
At the time the demonstration was made upon Petersburg by General Benjamin F. Butler the Hampton Legion was on the march from South Carolina to Richmond, and I, having been ordered in advance to Richmond, to procure suitable arms and accoutrements for the Legion, happened to be in Richmond at the time.
Having made all the necessary arrangements for these arms and accoutrements, I applied at the Adjutant-General's office, in Richmond, for permission to go out upon the lines nearer Petersburg and offer my services to the officer in command.
My request was granted, and I proceeded accordingly to Petersburg, and was assigned to the duty of inspecting and reorganizing the picket lines of communication between our lines north of Petersburg and south of Richmond.
I was on this duty when you determined to move your headquarters from Petersburg to Drury's Bluff, and accompanied you on your march from the lines north of Petersburg, via Chesterfield Court-house, to Drury's Bluff.
After reaching Drury's Bluff I was retained at your headquarters, and assigned to duty temporarily as one of your staff-officers.
During the day of May 15th Colonel Samuel Melton, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, notified me that you desired me to take your written and verbal instructions to General Whiting, at his headquarters, near Petersburg, as you intended attacking the enemy on the morning of the 16th, and felt anxious that there should, by no possibility, be any miscarriage of your instructions to General Whiting, or any misunderstanding as to their import.
My impression is that you had sent copies of your instructions through another source, and that you were merely taking the additional precaution to insure their receipt by him through me. Just before starting on my mission I was sent for by you, and in the presence of Colonel Melton the written despatches were given to me, and their contents carefully explained to me by you. 
You desired me to be in position to give them verbally to General Whiting, in case it became necessary for me to destroy them, to prevent any risk of their falling into the hands of the enemy, and at the same time you impressed upon me the importance of General Whiting implicitly obeying them, and you authorized me, if necessary, to state this to him. I received the despatches, started on my mission, and reached General Whiting's headquarters during the night of the 15th, and found him at his headquarters, in the Dunlop Castle, near Swift Creek, about three miles from Petersburg.
General Whiting read the despatches, expressed himself as understanding them entirely, and gave orders for the advance of his entire force by daylight the next morning. 
I remained at his headquarters during the night, and accompanied General Whiting in the morning upon his advance.
His forces were on the march by daylight, and advanced steadily until they struck the enemy's picket line.
The  column was then halted, and the force placed in line of battle.
We had heard the sound of your cannon at Drury's Bluff, and I expected an immediate advance by General Whiting of his line of battle, according to instructions.
For some reason not known to me at the time, however, there seemed to be considerable and unnecessary delay in the advance even of his skirmish line towards the enemy's pickets.
General D. H. Hill, who was also with General Whiting, and who was at that time occupying a similar position to me, that of acting temporarily as one of your staff-officers, had had some conversation with me during the morning as to your order of battle and your special instructions to General Whiting.
He also began to show considerable uneasiness at the unnecessary delay of General Whiting in making his advance.
We repeatedly approached General Whiting on the subject, together, but got no satisfactory replies—he apparently being engaged in arranging and rearranging his line of battle.
He finally stated that he was waiting to get reliable information from his scouts on his right flank, and that he did not desire to advance until satisfied that his right flank and rear were not threatened.
Later in the morning, upon being urged by General Hill and myself to advance, and on our insisting that your instructions were explicit, and after my stating to him that you had authorized me to say verbally to him that nothing should prevent him from attacking in his front, he said that his scouts reported that a force of the enemy had been seen near Port Walthall, and that he was apprehensive of being attacked on his right flank, in case he made any advance.
The enemy in our front had by this time placed a few pieces of cannon in position, and had opened fire with them; but General Hill and myself made a reconnoissance on the left, and reported to General Whiting that we were satisfied that a very small force confronted him. General Whiting, however, could not be induced by us to advance; and while intimating that he would do so later in the day, when he felt he could do so with safety, both General Hill and myself felt perfectly satisfied that, for some reason, he would not do so. After conference General Hill and myself decided that it would be best for him to remain with General Whiting, and, if possible, force him to advance; and that I should make my way as rapidly as possible around the lines and report the situation to you. 
General Dearing, who was in command of the cavalry forces, undertook to force a way for me through Chester Station, so as to avoid the detour around by Chesterfield Court-house.
He met with the enemy's pickets at Chester, and they were driven in by a gallant charge of General Dearing, who forced them back as far as the Half-way Station, and captured between Chester and that point a large number of stragglers from the enemy's lines; and on reaching Half-way Station we saw that the enemy was in a state of great disorganization and demoralization.
General Dearing captured several hundred prisoners at this point.
He then gave me a small escort, and I soon made my way around, and joined you on the turnpike, in advance of Drury's Bluff. President Davis was with you, and you were occupying a position which had been occupied in the morning by the enemy.
I reported substantially what I have stated above as to General Whiting's position, and I recollect distinctly stating to you very emphatically that you need not rely on any advance being made that day  by General Whiting.
My impression is that you had already arrived at that conclusion.
It was then quite late, and I understood that your right flank was then advancing.
Dark, however, soon came on, and during the night the enemy retired to the lines north of Bermuda Hundreds.
I have never had the slightest doubt that if General Whiting had followed your instructions the result would have been the capture by you of the entire force of General Butler. 
Yours, very truly, T. M.  Logan.

Please read over my telegrams of 15th inst., and you will perceive that you were not ordered to assault enemy's left on the Appomattox, but to march on the firing in this direction.
The best way to defend Petersburg is to annihilate the enemy here by a combined attack or a concentration of our forces.

G. W. Lay, Lieut.-Col. 
 Headquarters, Dept. N. C. And so. Va. In the field, near Chester, Va., May 29th, 1864. To his Excellency President Davis, Richmond, Va.: 
Sir,—I had the honor to receive yesterday afternoon, through Colonel Wood, your letter of the 28th inst., enclosing a copy of General Lee's letter of the same day, from near Atlee's Station.
I have telegraphed him to inform me when and where I could meet him in conference.
I am now awaiting his answer. 
The report you refer to of Butler's breaking up his encampment in my front is only partially true, and indicates probably a change of position, not a withdrawal of part of his forces.
The latest information received from the Signal Corps (27th inst.) is, that about four thousand men have been sent off by him. (See report of Major Milligan, herewith enclosed.) My force is so small at present that to divide it for the purpose of reinforcing Lee would jeopardize the safety of the part left to guard my lines, and, consequently, endanger Richmond itself.
The italics are ours.  
The question of abandoning, in part or in whole, my present position is a momentous one, which requires the most earnest consideration of the Government before it is adopted. 
The pontoon-train, reported by Major Milligan, on the 27th inst., as having been sent up to Butler, signifies probably an intention on his part to co-operate with Grant in his operations against Richmond, by throwing a bridge across the James River. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T.  Beauregard.

I am just from the front; reconnoissance in force of this morning shows it might be dangerous to send away Ransom's brigade, constituting over one-third available infantry force now here.
We must elect at present between Bottom's Bridge and railroad communication between Petersburg and Richmond. G. T.  Beauregard. 
 Headquarters, Department N. C. and so. Va., June 3d, 1864. Genl. Braxton Bragg, Comdg., etc., Richmond, Va.: 
General,—That there may not be hereafter any possible misapprehension of the part I am called upon to act in the momentous events which are transpiring, and which I cannot but watch with the most intense interest and solicitude, I send you herewith copies of the telegrams which have been exchanged between General Lee and myself since the 1st inst., at 4 P. M. 
You will not doubt of my readiness and anxiety to co-operate with General Lee in any manner that may be deemed most conducive towards the crushing of the foe in his front.
I shall be found ready and willing, at all times, to obey any orders the War Department may judge fit and proper to give on the subject; but I cannot, under existing circumstances, advise the withdrawal of more troops from this vicinity.
Already thirteen thousand out of twenty thousand infantry have been sent to the north side of the James River since the battle of Drury's Bluff, and with the forces remaining, unless taken temporarily and for an immediate encounter with the enemy, it might become impossible to prevent the latter from destroying the communications between Richmond and Petersburg; nay, from capturing Petersburg, which could not be re-taken without great sacrifice of life. 
If Ransom's brigade, numbering over one-third of the present available force in Johnson's division, were withdrawn from here, it would become necessary to abandon our lines in front of Bermuda Hundreds Neck, to assume a strategic  position at Port Walthall Junction, from thence to protect Drury's Bluff, the railroad, and Petersburg; the ironclad gunboats guarding the crossing of James River as far below Chaffin's Bluff as practicable. 
If Johnson's division were ordered to the north side of James River it would then be necessary to occupy the junction with at least one brigade of infantry, assisted by such cavalry (at least two regiments) as might be spared from General Dearing's brigade, or other cavalry in the field, to watch closely in front of the enemy's lines across Bermuda Hundreds Neck, and give timely notice of any offensive expedition from that quarter. 
I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T. Beauregard, Genl.

General,—In forwarding my report of the battle of Drury's Bluff, May 16th,  1864, it seems necessary that it should be accompanied by an explanation of the apparent inconsistency of its conclusions with my Special Order No. 11, May 17th, 1864, relieving the commander of the left wing, and commending in high terms the conduct of his command in the battle.
A copy of that order is annexed.
When it was issued I still assumed that he had properly felt and estimated the obstacles and hostile force reported by him in his immediate front, and that his reports were to be accepted as maturely considered and substantially accurate.
Subsequent investigation, necessarily requiring time, has, I regret to say, brought me to a different conviction. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T. Beauregard, Genl.

He will communicate to you a statement of forces and a letter bearing on the subject.
I beg you will send me by Colonel Paul such a verbal statement of your present position and future movements as you may feel at liberty to communicate, in order that I may be prepared to act in concert with you, according as circumstances may make it expedient. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T. Beauregard, Genl. 
Synopsis of General Wise's report of the operations around Petersbury on the 15th of June, 1864. 
The following forces were engaged: the 26th, 34th, 46th Virginia; 64th Georgia, Company F.; 23d South Carolina, Archer's Militia, Battle's and Hood's battalions, Sturdevant's battery, Dearing's cavalry, and other transient forces, making a total strength of 2738, but a really effective one of 2200 men of all arms. 
This force was distributed from Battery No. 1, on the left, to Butterworth's Bridge, on the right—a distance of nearly six miles, giving one effective man to every four yards and a half (4 1/2). The extreme right, from Butterworth's Bridge to the Appomattox River—say five miles—was without any force at all. 
At 7 A. M., on the 15th, General Dearing informs General Wise that his forces were hotly engaged with the enemy on the Broadway and City Point roads, not far from their forks.
General Wise takes command of the centre, from Battery 14 to 23, exclusive, and requests Colonel Colsten to take command of the right, from Battery 23 to Butterworth's Bridge. 
The cavalry made a handsome stand at their breastworks, and Graham's battery did great execution among the enemy's ranks.
But they advanced in such overwhelming force that, although their assaults were several times repulsed, they prevailed in flanking our cavalry breastworks, which were finally abandoned,  with the loss of one howitzer.
During that gallant stand of Dearing's command time was gained to make all possible preparations on the lines, and at about 10 A. M. the skirmishing on the left began to be serious. 
At 12 M. the enemy's cavalry approached our centre, dismounted, deployed skirmishers, and moved up as infantry.
Reinforcements had already been called for, from the north side of the Appomattox.
The repeated reply was to hold on—that reinforcements would be sent. 
From 12 M. to 2 P. M. the enemy pressed on the centre, apparently threatening the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad.
The line was, in consequence, closed from the right to support Colonel Goode and 34th Virginia.
At the same time Hood's battalion was sent to reinforce Colonel Page, on the left. 
Again additional troops were called for, the reply being that one brigade from Johnson's division had been ordered on, and that Hoke's division, which had left Drury's Bluff at 12.15 P. M., would arrive in Petersburg at 5 P. M. Orders to hold on at all hazards were given all over the lines. 
From 3 to 5 P. M. the enemy continued to press the centre, and, as was expected, concentrated upon batteries 5, 6, and 7, where the works were ineffably and contemptibly weak.
At 7.10 P. M. they entered a ravine between Nos. 6 and 7 and flanked No. 5. 
The line then broke, from No. 3 to No. 11, inclusive.
The whole line on the right was then ordered to close to the left, up to Battery No. 14; batteries 1 and 2 being still ours.
The 59th Virginia arriving at that time, was sent on the City Point Road towards Battery No. 2, to arrest the retreat of the line on the left.
Between 8 and 9 P. M. General Hagood's brigade of Hoke's division arrived, and, soon after, General Hoke himself, who took command. 
A new line was formed during the night from Battery No. 2, through Friend's field to the woods, and thence through them across the road leading to Dunn's house, and thence on the road to Webb's house. 
Hoke's division was placed on the left, Clingman's brigade forming its right.
On Clingman's right was Wise's brigade.
The right of Wise's brigade terminated on the apex of a high hill, between which and Webb's house there is a deep ravine.
An interval of a quarter of a mile was left across this ravine.
General Wise called the attention of General Hoke and General Johnson to that fact.
He was told that a regiment would be sent from Elliott's brigade to fill it. But on the night of the 16th, as late as 10 P. M., that gap had not been filled. 
At daybreak next morning it was announced that the enemy had driven back the brigade on the right of Wise's, leaving its right entirely exposed, except as far as protected by Blunt's battery. 
Wise's brigade stood firm and aided in restoring the lines, but sadly suffered from an enfilade fire.
Colonel Page was killed, Captain Wise, Brigade Inspector, wounded.
The command of the brigade then devolved upon Colonel Goode. 
The casualties in Wise's brigade, on June 15th, amounted to 12 killed, 62 wounded, and 129 missing. Only three regiments engaged. 
Ten guns were lost from batteries 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
No other reports were sent in. Every officer and man under General Wise's notice behaved with gallantry,  and the enemy were successfully repulsed and checked against great odds, until reinforcements arrived.

This should be published to the troops at once. 
You will send to Major-General Johnson a copy of this for his information and action. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Jno. M.  Otey, A. A. G.  
 Headquarters, Department N. C. and so. Va., Petersburg, Va., June 21st, 1864. Genl. Braxton Bragg, Comdg. C. S. Armies, Richmond, Va.: 
General,—Your communication of the 16th inst.—requesting me to inform you at what hour last night (15th) I ordered Major-General Johnson to evacuate the lines across Bermuda Hundreds Neck; at what hour during the night he made the movement; what force was ordered to replace him; and whether I informed General R. E. Lee of the movement; if so, at what hour, and by what channel of communication; also, whether any guns or other military stores were left by General Johnson's command—was not received by me until the evening of the 19th inst., else it would have met with an earlier acknowledgment. 
In reply thereto I have the honor to submit that, on the morning of the 15th inst., the force under my command for the immediate defence of Petersburg (about 2200 of all arms) consisted of Wise's brigade, some artillery, two regiments of Dearing's cavalry, and a few militia.
During the night of the 14th I received from you the following despatch: 
 Richmond, June 14th, 1864:9.10 P. M. Genl. Beauregard: 
General Lee reports Grant has abandoned his depot on the York, and moved to James River, he supposes about McClellan's old base, at Harrison's Landing.
Lee is on a line from Malvern Hill to White Oak Swamp.
He has sent Hoke's division to Drury's Bluff, with a view to reinforce you, in case Petersburg is threatened. Braxton Bragg, Genl.  
On its receipt the following order was immediately sent to Major-General Hoke: 
 Headquairters, Department N. C. And so. Va., June 14th, 1864. 
General,—The Commanding General directs that you move at once, as rapidly as possible, with your division to Petersburg, leaving one brigade at Walthall Junction. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, Jno. M.  Otey, A. A. G. 
To Major-Genl. R. F. Hoke, Drury's Bluff.
Early on the morning of the 15th I advised you in several despatches that the enemy had been strongly reinforced; that Dearing's pickets had been driven in; and that the enemy was moving in force towards the Baxter and Jerusalem plank road, and asked for reinforcements.
I also added that the time had arrived when an election must be made between the lines of Bermuda Neck and Petersburg.
With my small force it was an impossibility to hold both.
At 7 A. M. of the 15th I sent you the following despatch: 
 Swift Creek, Va., June 15th, 1864:7 A. M. Genl. Braxton Bragg, Richmond, Va.: 
Return of Butler's forces sent to Grant, arrival of latter at Harrison's Landing, renders my position more critical than ever, if not reinforced immediately; for enemy could force my lines at Bermuda Hundreds Neck, capture Battery Dantzler, now nearly ready, or take Petersburg, before any troops from Lee's  army or Drury's Bluff could arrive in time.
Can anything be done in the matter? G. T. Beauregard, Genl.  
Battery Dantzler was a new battery of heavy guns at Howlett's Hill, and formed the extreme left of our lines in front of Bermuda Hundreds Neck. 
At 1 h. P. M. I sent you and General R. E. Lee the following telegraphic despatch: 
 Swift Creek, Va., June 15th, 1864:1 P. M. Genl. Braxton Bragg, Richmond, Va.: 
Hoke's division is ordered to Petersburg; hope it will get there in time.
I will hold lines of Bermuda Hundreds Neck as long as practicable; but I may have to reinforce Hoke with Johnson's division, when lines would be lost.
I advise sending forthwith another strong division to intersection of turnpike and railroad near Port Walthall Junction. G. T. Beauregard, Genl.  
>Telegraph operator will send a copy of this despatch to General R. E. Lee. 
I received at 1.20 P. M. the following: 
 Richmond, June 15th, 1864: 12 M. To Genl. Beauregard: 
Hoke's division was ordered to you early this morning in time to be near at hand now, though his telegram of 11.30 says he had just received his orders and was marching.
You are better able to judge than I can be of the movements necessary to be made by the troops immediately with you. Braxton Bragg, Genl.  
At 1.45 P. M. I telegraphed you as follows: 
 Swift Creek, June 15th, 1864:1.45 P. M. Genl. Braxton Bragg, Richmond, Va.: 
Your telegram of 12 M. received.
I did not ask advice with regard to movement of troops, but wished to know preference of War Department between Petersburg and lines across Bermuda Hundreds Neck, for my guidance, as I fear my present force may prove unequal to hold both. G. T. Beauregard, Genl. 
To this I received no reply. 
The alternative of abandoning our lines in front of Bermuda Hundreds or Petersburg was thus presented.
My force was inadequate to maintain our extended lines, reaching from Drury's Bluff to this place.
The enemy, having been strongly reinforced, continued to press heavily towards Petersburg, and at 9.11 P. M. I sent you and General R. E. Lee the following telegraphic despatch: 
 Petersburg, Va., June 15th, 1864:9.11 P. M. Genl. Braxton Bragg, Richmond, Va.: 
Reinforcements not having arrived in time, enemy penetrated lines, from Battery 5 to 8, inclusive.
Will endeavor to retake them by daybreak.
I shall order Johnson to this point, with all his forces.
General Lee must look to the defences of Drury's Bluff and the lines across Bermuda Neck, if practicable. G. T. Beauregard, Genl.  
Telegraph operator will send a copy of this despatch to General R. E. Lee.  
Accordingly, at 10.20 P. M. I ordered Major-General Johnson to evacuate the lines in front of Bermuda Hundreds, leaving pickets and skirmishers to cover the movement until daylight, or later if necessary.
I hereto append a copy of the orders to Major-General Johnson.
At 11.15 P. M. I addressed the following telegrapic despatch to General R. E. Lee: 
 Petersrurg, Va., June 15th, 1864:11.15 P. M. Genl. R. E. Lee, Headquarters A. N. V.: 
I have abandoned my lines on Bermuda Neck, to concentrate all my forces here.
Skirmishers and pickets will leave there at daylight.
Cannot these lines be occupied by your troops?
The safety of our communication requires it. Five or six thousand men may do. G. T. Beauregard, Genl. 
In obedience to orders Major-General Johnson, after entirely securing the guns and other military stores, evacuated the lines of Bermuda Hundreds during the night, giving orders to the officer commanding the pickets and skirmishers to hold the lines until 6 A. M. of the 16th.
At the time of the evacuation no information had been received that reinforcements would be sent to refill these lines. 
The heavy guns, carriages, and chassis at Fort Dantzler were buried by Major-General Johnson, and were recovered on the re-occupation of lines, having been undisturbed and uninjured by the enemy. 
About 4 A. M. on the 16th a despatch was received from General R. E. Lee that a division was on its way to replace Major-General Johnson.
A staffofficer was immediately sent to General Johnson with this information and instructions to hold the lines as long as possible.
The promised division not arriving in time, our pickets and skirmishers left in charge of the lines were driven in early on the morning of the 16th. 
The result of the concentration of my forces at Petersburg was the successful defence of that place against repeated and persistent assaults, which were immediately afterwards made by the enemy with largely superior numbers. 
The foregoing simple narrative of the course of events contains, I believe, answers to all the inquiries embraced in your letter. 
I am, General, very respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T. Beauregard, Genl. 
 Parish of Saint James, Louisiana, Feb. 21st, 1874. To Genl. G. T. Beauregard, New Orleans: 
My dear General,—I take pleasure in forwarding to you, as I had promised I would, the following narration of an incident of the siege of Petersburg, which, from the circumstances of the case, may not be altogether useless to you, as an additional leaf to what is left of your valuable notes about the war. 
I remember that on or about the 17th of June, 1864, pending the heroic, and to me Providential, defence of Petersburg (the immediate result of which, front the battle of Drury's Bluff to that time, was the saving of Richmond), some forty or fifty prisoners were brought to me, for the purpose, as usual, of being  examined as to the name of their particular commands, their precise location, their aggregate number, and the time of their arrival in our front. 
These examinations, as you know, formed part of my general duties as Inspector, and I always endeavored to carry them through with all due care and attention.
I was ever exceedingly courteous towards prisoners, and made it a point to speak to them with the greatest kindness.
As far as my experience goes, I may safely assert that eight prisoners out of ten, whenever examined with prudence and discretion, invariably spoke the truth, to the best of their knowledge and understanding.
Very few ever refused to answer me; and I must say that information of more than ordinary importance to us was, at times, thus acquired from what they reported. 
On the occasion I here refer to I was more than usually careful in my demeanor towards these prisoners, because of your suspecting General Grant's army to be already on the move towards Petersburg, as was indicated, you thought, by Butler's evident boldness in our front. 
The substance of the information I obtained that day was, that General Grant was actually crossing the James; that such and such corps of his army, supposed to be facing General Lee's army, were already with Butler's troops; that the men had been made to go through long and fatiguing marches, and, to quote their own language, were loudly complaining of hard march and hard tack.
As soon as the result of my examination was reported to Headquarters you immediately despatched one of your aids, Captain Chisolm, to General Lee, to inform him of the circumstances above related.
General Lee's headquarters were, at that time, near Drury's Bluff, and yours, on account of the general skirmishing we had had the day previous, were, temporarily, in the very town of Petersburg. 
Not satisfied, apparently, with the message you had given to Captain Chisolm, and feeling more and more the necessity of being immediately reinforced, you also sent me to Drury's Bluff on the evening of the same day, my instructions being to see General Lee and read to him, as I had written them down, the answers of the different prisoners I had examined.
You told me to impress upon the General's mind the necessity of his sending over reinforcements to your assistance as soon as possible; that you had suspected for several days what had at last happened, and had so informed the War Department, but, as usual, with no satisfactory result; that you had no troops—or nearly none— left you, and that if the General did not come to your assistance, with his whole army, in less than forty-eight hours, God Almighty alone would save Petersburg and Richmond. 
I left as soon as I could get my horse ready, and arrived at General Lee's headquarters between twelve and one o'clock that night, having first procured a guide at General Anderson's headquarters, then established at the very spot where ours had been the day after the battle of Drury's Bluff. 
I was not admitted to General Lee. Colonel Taylor—I think it was Colonel Taylor—General Lee's Chief of Staff, thought it unadvisable to disturb the General, who had not long since retired, he said, and who needed rest.
Knowing  that I had no right to insist upon being shown into the General's presence, I thereupon informed Colonel Taylor of my whole message to General Lee, read him the prisoners' statements, and asked him to see the General, if I could not. 
His answer was, in substance, as follows: Those prisoners have evidently deceived you. The corps you speak of as being in front of Petersburg, or thereabout, are reported by our scouts as being still in our front.
We are certain of the fact, and, therefore, I see no use in speaking again to General Lee, who, by-the-by, has already seen Captain Chisolm to that effect, and has told him, substantially, what I now say to you. Tell General Beauregard that, as far as these corps are concerned—and we believe it to be the case with the others— there is, just now, no apprehension to be had.
My disappointment, on hearing the above, was so apparent, that Colonel Taylor, no doubt struck by it, left his tent, where I remained with an officer whose name I do not remember, and, coming back a few minutes afterwards, told me he had seen General Lee, and that he still maintained his first view of the case. 
It was evident to me that the report of the prisoners was looked upon as nothing but a fable, altogether unworthy of General Lee's attention, and scarcely worthy of our own. I was told, furthermore, that General Lee's reply to your remarks—that unless reinforcements were sent before forty-eight hours, God Almighty alone would save Petersburg and Richmond—was, that he hoped God Almighty would.
Now, I cannot exactly say whether it was Colonel Taylor who gave me the above as General Lee's answer, or whether it was Major Giles B. Cooke, of General Beauregard's staff, the evening after my visit to General Lee's headquarters.
Major Cooke had seen the General; I had not. Remarks identically the same as those made by me in your name might also have been made to General Lee, personally, by Major Cooke.
But I know the words quoted above by me were given as being those made use of by General Lee in answer to your remarks. 
Having nothing more to do or to say just then, I took leave of Colonel Taylor, and hastened back to Petersburg as fast as I could go. While on my way back I met Major Cooke, one of my assistant inspectors, who was hurrying to General Lee's headquarters with a third message from you. Major Cooke is the same officer I referred to in the preceding lines.
We exchanged a few words, I telling him of my ill-success, he declaring he would see the General and convince him of the absolute necessity of coming to our assistance; and, having no time to lose, we both started anew, on our respective errands. 
I was back at Headquarters early on the morning of the 18th of June, as you may remember, having taken no rest at all, and having ridden the whole night, going and coming. 
Petersburg was not taken.
Through you, and, thanks to your far-seeing ability, God Almighty did save it.
General Lee, with the high-minded, soldierly, as well as gentlemanly motives which ever characterized his acts, was no doubt impressed with the importance as well as the insistance of your different messages; and though, perhaps, still relying on the reports of his scouts, he nevertheless issued orders in compliance  with your most urgent request.
The fact is that Kershaw's division was already on the move before I had time to reach Petersburg, and on the 19th of June (I think it was a Sunday), before night, all, or nearly all, of General Lee's army was at Petersburg or its immediate vicinity, where also, and at the same time, was all, or nearly all, of General Grant's army. 
Your advice was to attack the very next day (19th), but General Lee was unwilling to issue the necessary orders to that effect, on account of the heavy marching his men had just gone through; and when, a few days afterwards, we did attack, the enemy, with the facilities he always had at his command, had already so intrenched himself as to give us no hope of dislodging him. 
I am, dear General, very sincerely yours, Alfred  Roman. 
Extract from a Diary kept by Major Giles B. Cooke during the late War. 
Wednesday, June 15th, 1864.—About 12.30 P. M. was sent into Petersburg by the General (Beauregard) from Dunlop's house, on Swift Creek, to advise General Wise that Hoke's division and Johnson's brigade had been ordered to reinforce.
The enemy commenced advancing on the city about 10 A. M. Was engaged all the afternoon bearing orders for the General.
About 7.30 P. M. the enemy carried by assault Battery No. 5, and soon after Batteries Nos. 6,7, 8, and 9.
These redoubts are the outer works of the city.
Hagood's brigade of Hoke's division arriving about the time that No. 5 fell, I accompanied General Hagood to his position, and was engaged with him on that duty until about 11 P. M.; was then ordered to assist Colonel Roman in posting the forage-trains of Johnson's and Hoke's divisions, and in moving Headquarters. 
Thursday, June 16th.—Left Colonel Roman for the front about 5 A. M. Breakfasted at Mrs. Paul's, and then reported to the General.
Was ordered by him to post Colonel Luke's regiment at the four bridges crossing the Appomattox.
Was then sent to look for the Chief of Artillery, and then joined the General at the Custom-house.
Was sent by the General about 9.45 A. M. to telegraph General Lee for reinforcements, as the enemy was pressing us in heavy force.
Returned to the General about 11.15 A. M. in company with Major Malloy, Chief Commissary.
About 1.30 P. M. rode over to camp at Dunn's Hill (across Appomattox) to assist Colonel Roman in arranging the wagon-trains; could not find him, but rode myself to see about the same; then returned to Headquarters, and slept for about an hour, as the firing had ceased.
Rode over to the Customhouse to see the General about striking tents about 6.30 P. M.; then went back to tell Colonel Roman to have the tents re-pitched at Dunn's Hill.
Walked into the city about 7.30 P. M., and went to Mrs. Paul's to supper. 
Friday, June 17th.—Arose about 7 A. M. and breakfasted.
Rode to the headquarters of General Johnson, and thence along our lines to General Hoke's headquarters, to make the necessary arrangements to prevent straggling.
Engaged up to about 7 P. M. in arranging and giving instructions about straggling.
Hearing heavy firing in the direction of Johnson's division, just as I reached the heights, I rode at once towards the headquarters of General Johnson. * * * For six mortal hours Johnson's division was sorely pressed by the Yankees.
Our  two divisions, Hoke and Johnson, held at bay for six hours three Yankee army corps (Hancock's, Burnside's, and Baldy Smith's); for about one hour of the six hours referred to the enemy's firing was perfectly terrific.
We were driven back some two or three times; but our men rallied and drove the Yankees back in their turn.
The firing ceased about 12.30 night; at which time I came in to the General at Johnson's headquarters, and gave him some despatches that were captured from a Yankee courier. 
Saturday, June 18th.—General Beauregard sent me at 1 A. M. to General Lee, to ask for reinforcements.
Rode about seventeen miles in about two hours, and after talking with the General (Lee) for some time and accomplishing, in part, my object in seeking him, I left for Petersburg.
On my way to General Lee's headquarters I called at General Anderson's headquarters, at the Hancock house, to tell him of my mission to General Lee, and to impress him with the importance of having some of his troops ready to march to General Beauregard's assistance.
On my return called at General Anderson's again, and joined Kershaw's division of his command that had been ordered by General Lee to proceed at once to Petersburg.
Reached Petersburg about 7 A. M., at the head of Kershaw's division, after posting which repaired to my quarters for rest. 
 Petersburg, Va., May 18th, 1874. 
My dear General,—Major Cooke has just handed me your package for examination.
I happen, fortunately, to have memoranda of the important period referred to, which throw a very strong light on it. 
On the morning of Tuesday, June 14th, 1864, you sent for me to come to your quarters—we were then at Dunlop's, on Swift Creek. Mr. Soule was with you at the time, and Colonel Otey, Adjutant-General, was sent for. You detailed to me with some minuteness the evidence of a large increase of strength to the enemy immediately in your front, and stated that a considerable force had been thrown across the river to the south side of the James, below City Point, the month of the Appomattox.
Hoke's division had some time before been sent to General Lee, and your force consisted then of Bushrod Johnson's division, Dearing's small command of cavalry, and the local forces.
After giving me these details of fact you directed Colonel Otey to have a statement made in detail of your force and its distribution on your lines; and ordered me to proceed with the same to General Lee, to place before him the facts of the situation, to express to him your conviction that the enemy would commence operations at Petersburg in a short time, and request that he should send you back Hoke's division, and aid you with such other force as would be adequate to the gravity of the situation.
The papers were finished in the Adjutant-General's office by about 2 A. M. on the morning of Wednesday, 15th, and I started to General Lee's headquarters.
These were difficult to find, but I reached them at about 12.30 o'clock, and saw Colonel Taylor, who secured me an interview with General Lee some half-hour afterwards.
About 1 P. M.—my notes say—General Lee declined to permit me to open the papers, stating that he knew we were weak, but that we would simply have to accomplish all we could with what we had. At first I feared that I would be dismissed without further attention, and an  intimation was made that I should return at once to you with that answer.
The General seemed much preoccupied.
I told him that it was but a small part of my instructions to show him your weakness, the importance of your line to his own safety, and the possibility of disaster to you, but to show the fact that attack was imminent.
Gradually his interest seemed to increase, and he stated that he had ordered Hoke's division to rejoin you before my arrival.
He then stated that you might rest assured that you were mistaken in supposing that the enemy had thrown any troops to the south side of James River; that a few of Smith's corps had come back to your front—nothing more—and that it was probable the enemy would cross the James, though, he reiterated, no part of his force had yet done so, because he could do nothing else, unless to withdraw altogether, as had been done by McClellan, which he did not believe General Grant thought of. He then said you might be assured that if you were seriously threatened he would send you aid, and, if needed, come himself.
With some kind messages to you he then dismissed me. 
When I reached Dunlop's you, with your whole staff, I was informed, were at Petersburg, and I rejoined you there, making a verbal report substantially as herein stated.
You informed me that Batteries 5 to 8 had been taken, and ordered me to proceed to the road east of Hare's Newmarket race-course, where I would aid in posting Hagood's command, just in by rail, on Wise's left, the brigade of the latter to rest its right on Battery 9.
When I met General Wise, at the point indicated, he informed me that Battery 9 had also been captured, and your orders were modified.
You then determined to withdraw Bushrod Johnson from Bermuda Hundreds Neck, leaving a thin picket-line, and quickly followed the order by another to bring his whole force.
They arrived during the night and next morning, Thursday, 16th. Colonel Roman and Major Cooke had in the mean time been despatched to General Lee successively on substantially the same message with mine, but with improved evidence of the enemy's presence. 
The enemy strangely contented themselves with the capture of the line up to Battery 9, and showed no activity until Thursday morning, when they skirmished sharply on our right, and a brief action of some importance took place on our right.
On Friday, 17th, skirmishing was very active in the morning, which in the evening increased to a battle, distinguished by heavy loss on our right and easy success on our left.
At one time matters looked more critical to the integrity of our line than I ever saw it up to the time when we left for the Southwest.
Prisoners captured showed that you had in front of you Smith's corps, Burnside's corps, and Hancock's—your sole force being Hoke's and Johnson's divisions, and the local force, with Dearing's cavalry and Jones's artillery.
At the most critical time the capture of one of Burnside's aids with a despatch from Burnside asking aid from General Meade, endorsed by General Meade with directions to get support from Smith, occurring just as a message from Hoke arrived announcing the easy repulse of Smith, enabled you to reinforce Johnson from Hoke's command and make your position safe.
That Friday night the lines up to the Jerusalem plank roak were finished and occupied, which never were taken.
The next morning, Saturday, 18th, General Lee arrived, and his whole army were in position confronting Grant by Sunday morning. 
I have reason to believe that on Saturday you proposed to General Lee to turn Grant's left flank, you covering his own left flank, and attacking Grant's right as he made the new front, giving the opinion that the two forces, flushed with the confidence of recent success, would crush Grant in the fork of the two rivers.
And General Lee objected, on the ground that it would compromise his army, though he believed the movement would succeed. 
Most truly, your old friend and servant, Samuel B.  Paul. Genl. G. T. Beauregard. 
 New Orleans, March 20th, 1874. 
Dear General,—Agreeably to your request I take pleasure in giving you my recollection of some of the incidents connected with your memorable defence of Petersburg, when first attacked by General Grant's army, in June, 1864. 
On a Wednesday, the 15th day of June, 1864, at about 12 o'clock, while we were encamped at Dunlop's farm, on Swift Creek, near Petersburg, you received intelligence that our lines in front of Petersburg were being attacked in force by the enemy.
You left at once, with such members of your staff who were with you at the time, for Petersburg, examining on your way there our lines of fortifications situated on the left, and you reached Petersburg at about 6 o'clock P. M. 
Upon your arrival you found that Batteries Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, situated nearest the Appomattox on our left, had been attacked and taken by the enemy. 
After visiting General Wise, inspecting with him the lines of fortifications in our possession, and giving the necessary orders for the defence of the city during the night, you repaired to the Post-office Building, in Petersburg, and established there your temporary headquarters. 
General Hoke, with his division, arrived at about ten o'clock that evening, and was stationed on our left, fronting the enemy, where we had lost our batteries.
Owing to the jaded condition of General Hoke's troops, after their forced march, you determined not to attack, and ordered the General to intrench himself in the position he occupied.
This he effectually did during the night. 
On Wednesday, 15th, 10.20 P. M., finding that the enemy was still increasing his numbers and encroaching on your lines, you telegraphed General Lee that you would order General Bushrod Johnson to Petersburg, and would henceforth intrust the defence of our lines at Bermuda Hundreds to him (General Lee). General Bushrod Johnson arrived during Thursday night, and was placed on the right, near the Jerusalem plank road. 
I remained with you constantly, night and day, from Wednesday, 15th, until Saturday, after the arrival of General Lee, and witnessed the almost superhuman efforts by which Petersburg was saved through the heroism and undaunted courage of the handful of men under you. I shall ever remember with pride your noble and successful resistance of that terrible onslaught of three  corps of General Grant's army on the three feeble divisions under Generals Hoke, Wise, and Bushrod Johnson, during that eventful Friday night, the 17th of June. 
During those three memorable days, in the capacity of your aid, I received, read, and wrote out all the telegrams you received from and sent to General Lee, and to the Government at Richmond. 
After informing General Lee several times that you were being confronted by the whole of Grant's army, and receiving no reply, you sent, on Friday, the 17th, at 5 P. M., a telegram to General Lee, that unless reinforced you would evacuate Petersburg the next day (Saturday), at 12 o'clock. In answer to this—and my memory is very clear upon this point—you received a telegram couched in these terms: 
 Drury's Bluff, Friday, June 17th: P. M. [Or, Saturday, June 18th: A. M.] Geul. Beauregard: 
Am not yet satisfied as to General Grant's movements; but upon your representations will move at once on Petersburg. R. E.  Lee. 
Early Saturday morning General Kershaw's division, leading the advance of General Lee's army, arrived in Petersburg, and was at once ordered to extend our lines on the right. 
General Lee arrived, I think, at about nine o'clock
He arrived at 11.30 A. M. on that day. Saturday morning. You rode with him to the front, with the view of inducing him to attack the enemy, if he found it practicable.
He decided not to attack, and our men commenced putting up the intrenchments, which they so nobly defended until April, 1865. 
Hoping that the few data I have herein given you may be of service to you for your history of the siege of Petersburg, 
I remain, yours truly, Saml.  Choppin, M. D., ex-Medical Inspector, C. S. A. To Genl. G. T. Beauregard. 
Telegram. clay's House, June 17th, 1864:1.45 P. M. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, Petersburg, Va.: 
Fifth Corps (Warren's) crossed Chickahominy at Long Bridge on the 13th; was driven from Riddel's Shop by General Hill, leaving many dead and prisoners on our hands.
That night it marched to Westover.
Some prisoners were taken from it on the 14th.
Have not heard of it since.
All prisoners taken here are from 10th Corps. R. E. Lee, Genl. Official. W. H.  Taylor, A. A. G. 
Appendix to chapter XXXVIII.  
Major-General B. R. Johnson's statement of the explosion of the mine at Petersburg, July 30th, 1864. 
on the 27th of July, 1864, the enemy was observed to be moving large forces to the north side of the James—to be showing much activity in that direction, leading us to anticipate some active operations there.
This was, no doubt, a piece of strategy or a trick to deceive us; and it had, to a certain extent, that effect, for movements were made on our side correspondingly.
General Field's division, which had been holding the part of our line of defences on the right of my division, was taken out of the trenches, and Colquitt's brigade, of Hoke's division, was temporarily transferred to my command, in exchange of Gracie's brigade, and I was left to hold, with less force, defences double the length, or more, of that which I had previously defended.
Indeed, my understanding is that my command was all the troops in our trenches when the mine was exploded; all of the rest of the army having been moved or held ready to meet any demonstration the enemy might make on the north side of the James River. 
About five minutes before five o'clock on the morning of the 30th of July the enemy sprung a large mine under that portion of my breastworks, about two hundred yards north of  the Baxter road, known as Pegram's salient.
In this salient there were four guns of Captain Pegram's battery, and the 18th and 22d South Carolina regiments of Elliott's brigade occupied the parapet in the battery and adjacent to it. The 22d extended from a point some seventy yards to the right of the right gun to a point beyond, but near the left gun of the battery.
The 18th was posted on the left of the 22d South Carolina regiment.
The regiments of Elliott's brigade were distributed along the parapet from left to right as follows: the 26th, 17th, 18th, 22d, and 23d South Carolina regiments.
Wise's brigade was next to the right, and Colquitt's brigade our very extreme right; Ransom's brigade on my left, extending to the Appomattox River, and my whole line was extended to an extreme and insecure attenuation, without any reserve under my command, or that I am aware of. We had suspicions that the enemy was running a mine under our works, and, under direction of our Engineers, a trenchcavalier was made in the rear of the salient, but terminating on the south, just to the right of Pegram's battery.
It should have been run farther to the south. 
The mining gallery was run along two wings extending to the right and left of the main shaft, parallel to the interior crest of our work, nearly under the foot of the slope of the banquette, and it destroyed a portion of the front or main line of our fortification and a little part of the right of the trenchcava-lier at its junction with the main line. 
The crater measured 135 feet in length, 97 feet in breadth, and 30 feet deep.
It was estimated that more than one hundred thousand tons of earth were thrown out. The two right guns of Pegram's battery were not disturbed.
The two left guns were thrown out in front of our works and the carriages destroyed,  and only 8 men out of 28 men and 2 officers of the battery escaped alive and unhurt.
Five companies of the 22d and four companies of the 18th South Carolina regiments were blown up, or mainly destroyed, by the falling earth. 
The 22d South Carolina regiment lost 170 men and officers170 
 18th had killed 4 officers and 39 men86 
 wounded 5 38  
Battery 22 
—— 
Aggregate losses known to have occurred from explosion278 
Of 4 officers and 72 men missing from the 18th regiment, over and above the foregoing estimate, a part may have been blown up or killed by falling earth, but most of them were supposed to have been captured.
Each brigade of my division had been previously instructed that, in case of an attack or breach on any point of my line, they should close and fight towards that point, leaving a picket-line behind; which was promptly done on this occasion.
When the cloud of dust had subsided the enemy was found in the breach.
Some four flags were counted, and a continued line of white and black troops came pouring on from the enemy's lines to support those in advance, while their artillery, mortars, and cannon opened all along their lines, the heavier fire being concentrated on our works and ground adjacent to the crater, and mainly from batteries near the Baxter road, where since the 16th of June the enemy seemed to be building, batteries and strong works. 
The 23d and part of the 22d South Carolina regiments, on the right, and 17th and 18th, on the left of the crater opened a destructive fire from our parapets on the advancing column and on the enemy in the breach.
The flanking arrangements of our works on both sides of the breach afforded peculiar advantages, and soon the fire along the line of my division extended far out on each flank, wherever the enemy's column could be reached, and swept the ground in front of the crater. 
To the men on the left of Wise's brigade, occupying the eminence south of Baxter road, about two hundred yards from the crater, the enemy's masses presented a most inviting target. 
Wright's battery of four guns, admirably located and intrenched on the left of Elliott's brigade, and in rear of our front line, poured its whole column of fire on the enemy's masses and right flank.
The position of this excellent battery was perhaps unknown to the enemy, and the superior manner in which it was served, the rapidity of its fire, and the terrible effect on the enemy's forces, no doubt greatly astonished and demoralized them.
One gun of Davidson's battery, commanded by Lieutenant Otey, occupied a position on the right of the Baxter road, on the eminence at the left of Wise's brigade, admirably adapted to throwing canister into the enemy's left flank, and, with Wright's battery, to sweep the ground in front of the breach with a destructive cross-fire.
It opened with a few rounds, but was soon deserted by officers and men (for which the officer was duly sentenced). The gun was afterwards manned and officered from Wise's brigade, and did excellent service under Colonel Goode. 
Major Haskell's mortar-battery, in charge of Captain Lamkin, consisting of  four Coehorns, on the Jerusalem plank road, and one Coehorn and two 12-pound mortars, in the ravine some two hundred yards to the left and rear of the breach, and two mortars, to the left of Wright's battery, were all opened promptly on the assaulting columns.
The practice of the four mortars on the plank road was admirable.
Their shells dropped with precision upon the enemy's masses, huddled in disorder in front and in the crater. 
Some three mortars, on the right of Baxter road, commanded by Lieutenant Langhorn, opened and continued at intervals with good effect until the close of the engagement.
As soon as I ascertained that the enemy had sprung the mine and broken my line (the explosion aroused me) near the centre, I communicated with the brigade commanders in both wings of the division, now completely cut apart, and instructed them to carry out former injunctions, extend the intervals between the men on the parapet, and reinforce the wings of Elliott's, where the weight of the enemy's attack must first fall.
At the same time I sent two staffofficers to get reinforcements.
One of them returned in due time, and reported that General Mahone would move to our support with part of his command. 
As soon as the enemy occupied the breach they attempted to advance along our trenches upon the flanks of our broken line; but our men, sheltering themselves behind the angles and flanks of our works and temporary barricades, and in boyaux, covered ways, and ravines, running out to the rear of our line, and about piles of earth at their bomb-proofs, opened a fatal fire at every point where the foe exposed themselves.
Thus their advance was stayed (for five hours), and they commenced the work of intrenching, while they still tried by more cautious means, and by organizing advancing columns, to press back our men and to march through our line to the rear.
Brigadier-General S. Elliott, commanding the South Carolina brigade, was making prompt disposition of his forces to meet the enemy and to occupy the main portion of the trenchcava-lier, when he was dangerously wounded.
The command of the brigade devolved on Colonel F. W. McMaster, of the 17th Regiment.
Having received reinforcements of one regiment from Colonel McAfee, commanding Ransom's brigade, he directed Colonel Smith, with the 26th South Carolina regiment and three companies of the 17th South Carolina regiment, to form in the ravine running up from the left to the rear of the breach, and thus a rear line was formed, consisting of the 25th North Carolina, 26th South Carolina, and three companies of the 17th South Carolina regiment, from left to right, in the order named.
Some fourteen Federal flags were soon counted in our works.
At the same time the 24th and 49th North Carolina regiments had promptly closed in on the part of the 17th South Carolina regiment remaining at our breastworks.
Now the enemy attempted, with a force extending to the front and rear of our parapet, to charge on our left; but our forces on the left, aided by the fire from the new line in rear, met and repulsed this charge; and though the enemy continued to fight along our parapets, our men on the left, taking advantage of every little covered point, returned their fire and held them in check. 
In the mean time similar contests were going on on the right of the crater.
The remaining men of the 22d South Carolina regiment, under Captain Shed, and those of the 23d South Carolina regiment, aided by the 26th and part of the 46th  Virginia regiments, held the enemy in check on that side.
They succeeded in placing a barricade across our trenches and planting themselves behind it and in boyaux running to the rear, and maintained a position within seventy-five yards of the crater for about five hours, during which the enemy never drove them a foot to the right, though they several times attempted to move on that flank. 
The 59th Virginia regiment, under Captain Wood, also formed in a ditch running perpendicular to the rear of our main works, and whenever the enemy formed in rear of the breach, or attempted to change to the right or left, opened fire and aided to drive them back to the crater and lines.
On this side the forces mainly engaged were the 59th and 26th Virginia regiments, and the 22d and 23d South Carolina regiments; two guns of—battery, near the junction of the Jerusalem plank road and Baxter road; one gun of Davidson's battery, on left of Wise's brigade, and two mortar batteries. 
The assailing force of the enemy was said to be the 9th Army Corps and parts of two others.
They were held in check for five hours by little more than three regiments of Elliott's South Carolina brigade, two regiments of Ransom's brigade, two regiments of Wise's brigade, and artillery.
Demonstrations were also made by the enemy on the south of the Baxter road and on Ransom's brigade, towards the left of my command, where they were engaged for a time on Taylor's Creek. 
General Mahone's command arrived about 10 o'clock A. M., and the 61st North Carolina regiment, of Hoke's division, arrived at the same time.
This regiment and one brigade of Mahone's division had formed in the ravine, in rear of Pegram's salient, and Mahone was waiting for a second brigade to come up, when the enemy made a demonstration to advance.
He met them by a charge in which the 25th and 49th North Carolina, and the 26th and part of the 17th South Carolina regiments, all under Colonel Smith, of Elliott's brigade, joined, moving on the left of General Mahone's line.
The enemy were driven from threefourths of the trench-cavalier and most of the works on the left of the crater.
During this charge of our troops many of the enemy, black and white, abandoned the breach and fled precipitately to the rear, while the left of Wise's brigade, and one gun of Davidson's battery, poured their fire, at a distance of from one hundred and fifty to five hundred yards, upon the flying mass. 
A second unsuccessful charge having been made with Wright's brigade, of Mahone's division, about 11 o'clock A. M., I proceeded to concert a combined movement on both flanks of the crater, and a charge was accordingly made about 1 o'clock P. M.—time agreed upon—which gave us entire possession of the crater and our whole line.
This charge was made on the left and rear of the crater by Sanders's brigade of Mahone's division, and by the 61st North Carolina regiment, Hoke's division, and 17th South Carolina regiment, Johnson's division; and on the right by the 23d and a fragment of the 22d South Carolina regiments, no other forces being available on this end of the line.
General Mahone took charge of the forces charging on the left of the crater, while I proceeded to the right through the long line of boyaux necessary to be passed in going from left to right of the crater, through which only our communication  could be prudently made.
Previously to this charge the incessant fire and attacks made on both flanks of the enemy at the crater had caused many to run the gauntlet of our cross-fire in front of the breach, so that we captured but three stands of colors and about one hundred and thirty men. The final charge was therefore made with little difficulty. 
My losses were 66 officers and 856 in killed, wounded, and missing—aggregate 922, including Colquitt's brigade, and omitting Gracie's. 
The losses of the enemy were estimated at that time, from such information as we gathered, at between five and six thousand.
I suppose accurate statements can be now commanded. 
I have not time to be concise or to write with any care, or even to read over this paper.
I have heard that all the credit has been given, by some one publishing his views, to Mahone's division.
I think this has been rebutted by General Cadmus Wilcox, of New Orleans.
You can accumulate facts from him and General Beauregard, as well as from officers named in command—especially Colonel McMaster. 
 Columbia, S. C., Feb. 14th, 1872. To Genl. G. T. Beauregard, New Orleans: 
Dear Sir,—General W. H. Wallace, the commander of Evans's old brigade and successor of General Stephen Elliott, sent me, in December last, your letter of November 13th, 1871, forwarded through General Bonham, with the request that I should give you the report of the brigade at the explosion at Pegram's salient, July 30th, 1864, as I had the honor to command the brigade on that occasion. 
I was so overwhelmed with railroad trials in the United States Court at the time of the arrival of your letter it was impossible for me to send even the meagre account this communication contains.
My trunk, with copies of all my reports, was burned at Petersburg, and it is difficult for me to recall any items which would be of service to you. General Elliott being in command of the brigade before the battle, I know nothing accurately of the batteries except those immediately on the lines.
I have forgotten even the names of the batteries and the mortar companies on the hills and ravines concentrating on Pegram's salient. 
Although the subject was one of all-absorbing interest—for, not more than ten days before, I heard your Engineer (Colonel Stevens, I believe, was his name) say, while we were standing in the little redoubt behind Pegram's battery, that in a week's time the Yankees would explode their mine there—still, many facts which seemed to me indelible have faded away. 
As my burrow was immediately behind the battery I was much relieved the next day to be removed down the hill about seventy-five yards. Colonel Fleming, of the 22d, was buried up in my old quarters. 
At break of day the explosion occurred.
I bounced out of my den and saw the descending mass of matter.
The brigade present consisted of the 26th, 17th, 18th, 22d, and 23d regiments of South Carolina Volunteers, in the order mentioned, the left of the 26th resting on right of Ransom's brigade, in the hollow towards the river.
Nearly the whole of the 18th and a small portion of left wing of 22d were in the most of the explosion. 
As soon as I gained the trench there was a rush of the men of the 18th down the trench against my regiment (17th); and numbers of my own men, panicstricken, and just aroused from their sleep, scratched at the counterscarp like frightened cats.
This was momentary.
Jumping on the banquette, I discovered the Yanks pouring into the mine, and very little firing on their line.
In less than five minutes time our men recovered from their panic, the men of the 18th falling in indiscriminately with mine, and we shot with great rapidity and execution.
About the same time the battery on the left of the ravine, a short distance in rear of Ransom's brigade, did great execution, and fired about six hundred shots in a short time.
This battery I observed specially; the others, in rear and on right, also did good execution. 
In ten or fifteen minutes after the explosion General Elliott came along, with Colonel Smith, who commanded the 26th Regiment, and ordered me to take my regiment and follow him on the brow of the hill and form a line, and charge the enemy out of the mine.
Smith had a few of his men cramped up in the ditch following him. I waited a few moments until Smith and some of his men were out of the way, and extended the order along my line.
Saw Elliott, Smith, and about half a dozen men get out of the ditch on the brow of the hill.
General E. was shot immediately after he got up. The ditch being crowded, it was a slow process to get out. 
As soon as Elliott was shot he was borne past me, and spoke to me to do the best I could.
His aids reported to me immediately, and rendered good service during the day. 
As soon as I took command I countermanded the order given by General Elliott.
It struck me as rashness to endeavor to make men get out of the ditches and attempt to form a line under fire on the top of the hill, at fifty or seventyfive yards from the crater, exposed from head to heels to the fire from the crater and the enemy's line, which was eighty yards from the crater.
It was simply an impossibility.
I observed at this time the crater full of men, and at least fourteen regimental flags.
I counted either fourteen or sixteen flags, and I was in a rock's throw of them. 
My apprehension was the men in the crater would rush down the hill and get in the rear of my line in the ravine which General Mahone afterwards came up in. I ordered Colonel Smith, of the 26th, to take all his men he could gather and immediately to go down the ditch to General E.'s quarters, to go up this ravine and lie down, and if the Yankees endeavored to rush down to resist them.
As Smith's regiment was quite small I detached three of my largest companies, under Captain Crawford, to co-operate with Smith.
It gave me the greatest anxiety until Smith's command got in position.
As I believed the fate of Petersburg depended on filling up this gap, I spread the remainder of the 17th and the part of the 18th that remained along the line until it struck Ransom's brigade, and fought the enemy from behind the traverses as well as I could.
We threw up barricades across the trench at various places.
Many of the enemy jumped over the back part of the crater, got into the rear ditch,  which communicated with the trench which went into Pegram's salient, and pressed me on my right flank.
Nearly all of my two right companies were killed, wounded, and captured in the successive hand-to-hand fighting we had here.
Once, when my men retreated to the succeeding bend, I was left between the enemy and my command.
Being anxious about Smith occupying the position I assigned him, I had taken a position back of a little mound close to the sink, from which position I could make a reconnaissance of the ravine, and on return up the little ditch to the main trench I observed the trench for twenty yards free of men. As soon as I got back we made a new barricade. 
I had before this time sent couriers to General Bushrod Johnson, and one to the right wing of the brigade, from which I was cut off by the crater, informing them I was in command, and to resist as best they could until the reinforcements which General J. was sending up should arrive. 
The battle raged, with intervals, until near 10 o'clock A. M. By this time the enemy pushed advances half-way down the area.
I was near the place where the covered way entered the trench.
As soon as I arrived there Colonel Fleming, of Ransom's brigade, suggested to me a capital place for a barricade at a bend about thirty yards distant, and I ordered him to superintend its construction.
As he left my side he was shot in the neck, and fell dead at my feet. 
In a few moments afterwards General Johnson sent for me to come to Elliott's quarters by the spring on the covered way. When I went I told him how I had arranged the men in the ravine to resist the enemy, if they attempted to get in our rear.
It is surprising they did not make that break.
I myself saw officers in the crater endeavoring, as I thought, to induce their men to make the dash; but Smith, after the battle, informed me they did make the attempt; but his men rose and delivered a volley, and intimidated them so they did not repeat the effort, but pursued what they supposed the safer course and followed down the trench. 
A short time after I first met General J., General Mahone came up with a few men. From my present recollection I would say this was, at the earliest, 10 o'clock A. M. It was a considerable time before any number of men came; when they did they marched up the ravine and laid down with the men Smith had already there.
General M. had a long interview with General J., and obtained from him information of localities, etc. 
It must have been two hours before General M. got his men ready.
General J. then directed me to add the balance of the 17th Regiment to General M.'s command, and asked me to put my best officer over them.
I ordered Lieut.-Colonel J. N. Celp to come up and receive orders from General J. He then took all of the 17th he could collect and formed on line with General Mahone. 
I think the charge was made about 12 o'clock M., and the whole battle was over in an extremely short time.
I never have seen so sudden a suspension of a battle. 
I remember a little circumstance which impresses the fact of the time on my memory.
My orderly brought my dinner about 3 o'clock P. M.—certainly not later than 4 o'clock. My adjutant sent for me to the brigade headquarters, and I went up to my own quarters.
I had to walk over dead Yankees and niggers,  the little passage from the trench to my den having two or three dead in it, and in my quarters there were two wounded negroes, one of whom had rested his head on a copy of Paley's Philosophy I had to while away a leisure moment with and bloodied it up. And my lieutenant-colonel, adjutant, sergeant-major, and myself ate with great relish our coarse fare literally in the midst of the dead and dying.
To enable my orderly to come with safety to the lines by this time from the wagon-camp to the battle-field the battle must have been over by 1 o'clock P. M. 
My adjutant prepared as correct a report as we could a few days after the explosion, and, feeling a little indignant that General Mahone's troops had all the credit for the fighting, got the editor of the Petersburg Index to publish a list of the casualties of Elliott's brigade. 
I had the article, clipped from the paper, in my pocket for months after the war, and, unfortunately, the casualties of my regiment (17th) was torn off; but by deducting from the aggregate the balance will indicate the loss of the 17th Regiment at 135; of these, I remember, 24 were killed outright on the field, including 3 officers—all I can now recall.
I found out afterwards that 27 men of my right company next the mine were captured and carried to Elmira; 14 of these 27 died of harsh treatment in the few months' confinement. 
The part of the publication I have preserved is as follows:

It will be seen from the above that the brigade lost a total of 677.
In the explosion 6 officers and 50 men are known to have been killed; 11 officers and 249 men are still unaccounted for; but the majority are supposed to have been killed by the explosion.
The 18th and the 22d are the regiments which suffered most from the explosion.
My recollection is, 21 men of Pegram's battery were buried in the mine. 
I regret I have no copy of my report, and fear the details herein furnished will be of no service.
Colonels Bonham and Wallace—the latter afterwards my brigadier—were my ranking officers, but both were absent on leave. 
With the hope that history will yet do you justice for your noble defence of Petersburg, and especially for your remarkable repulse of Grant on the 17th and  18th of June, when your hundreds repelled his thousands, I remain, with undiminished attachment for you, as one of the beloved Generals of our lost cause, 
Your most obedient servant, F. W.  McMASTER, Lieut.-Col. 17th Regt. S. C. V. 
note.—We kept the enemy at bay on the trench at the mine for, I suppose, three hours. We had the advantage in using the little embankments running to our works; but after they were foiled here some of their men, who were on the outside of the mine and our trench, ran down on the outside of our trench and shot in rear of our men on these traverses, and cut off some, that caused the men to retreat down the hill.
But when we made the last barricade which Lieutenant-Colonel Fleming pointed out to me the enemy in front of the trench could no longer use our front breastwork, as the lines so bent the left wing of Ransom's brigade commanded it, and they were checked there, and never could advance a step farther; and if Mahone had never come up the enemy's only chance would have been by a sally from the rear of the mine. 
I have read this over to Mr. T. J. Lamoth, who acted as sergeant-major for me—a very intelligent gentleman, who came to the regiment that morning, just before the explosion, and he confirms the above narrative.
He thinks the explosion occurred about half an hour before sunrise.
He believes the lines were saved that day by keeping the men in the trenches and sending Colonel Smith and his men in the ravine. F. W.  McM. 
Appendix to chapter XXXIX. 
Battle of Weldon road.  
Extract from General Hagood's Memoirs.  
about the middle of August, Grant threw a large part of his force across the James at Deep Bottom and advanced towards Richmond.
It resulted in his repulse, but drew a large part of our force from Petersburg, and thus gave him an opportunity to strike at the Weldon Railroad, within three miles of which his left then rested.
He obtained possession of a considerable portion of it— from Davis's farm, near the city, southward—suffering a loss of a thousand men. On the 19th Colquitt's and Clingman's brigades of Hoke's division were detached to take part with other troops in an effort to dislodge him. They failed of success, though the operation resulted in inflicting heavy loss upon the enemy, including the capture of three thousand prisoners. General Clingman was wounded, and never again rejoined his brigade.
The fight was to be renewed on the 20th, and on the night of the 19th, about nine o'clock, General Hagood received an order to turn over his brigade in the trenches to the senior officer present, and, taking with him only his aid, report to General A. P. Hill to command a brigade from Bushrod Johnson's division in the expected fight.
Bushrod Johnson was holding the lines next to Hoke, and he sent no organized brigade, but a regiment from each brigade of his division.
It seemed that his  habit was to keep one regiment from each of his brigades resting in rear of the lines, and he sent such as happened to be there at the time.
The regiments commenced arriving at the rendezvous, near the Lead-works, where Hagood was to meet them about 11.30 P. M., and by 3 A. M. Hagood had effected a brigade organization with them, appointing hap-hazard an acting staff, and learning their names and those of his regimental commanders, for it was too dark to see their faces.
He reported to General Hill, who was asleep in his ambulance near by. When General Hill learned the heterogeneous character of the brigade sent him he, much to Hagood's relief, declined to receive it, and directed the regiments returned to their division.
Nothing was done that day; the enemy were left to intrench undisturbed across the coveted road.
In the afternoon Hagood's own brigade was withdrawn from the trenches, and, marching through Petersburg, bivouacked beyond its southern limits to the right of Battery 45.
But 59 officers and 681 men marched out of the trenches.
Sixty-seven days and nights in them without relief had shorn the brigade of two-thirds of its numerical strength, and so debilitated were the sickly and enfeebled remainder that they tired badly in the short evening's march.
The brigade was itself only in the unconquerable spirit of the remnant which clung to its banner.
When General Hagood again, in pursuance of his directions, reported to General Hill he felt that justice to his men required it, and he unhesitatingly asked and received the promise that he should not be used in the next day's work, if it could be avoided.
The change from the cramped and noisome trench to the freedom of the bivouac, and the call upon the men for action instead of endurance, aroused their spirits wonderfully, and, although it rained all night, the fires of brushwood crackled merrily; and then was once more heard the light laugh, the ready joke, and the busy hum of voices, as the men prepared their suppers or smoked their pipes, stretched at length before the exhilarating blaze.
At 2 A. M. of the 21st of August the brigade was aroused, and, moving out at half-past 3, followed the column destined for the day's engagement.
It still rained; and after a toilsome march through mud and water, first down the Squirrel Level road, and then across towards the Poplar Spring church, more or less skirmishing going on all the time by the flankers on our left, the brigade was directed to halt by the road-side and remain in reserve while the column passed on. It had now ceased raining, and shortly afterwards, about a mile in front of us, the fire of skirmishers was heard, and a heavy fire of artillery was opened. 
The men laid down and rested from the unwonted fatigue of the march.
The firing became more earnest in front, and in about half an hour a courier from General Hill arrived, and directed us to hasten to the front and report to Major-General Mahone.
Proceeding by a short cut into the Vaughan road, under the guidance of the courier, and up that towards Petersburg, until within six hundred yards of the Flowers House, we turned across the field to the right and proceeded towards the railroad, in the vicinity of the Globe Tavern.
A number of pieces were in position in this field, shelling the railroad; and the enemy's batteries in that direction, though not visible from woods intervening, were replying vigorously.
General Hagood, moving in column of fours, passed at double-quick across this field, suffering some casualties from exploding shells,  and as he reached its farther border a major-general rode up, announcing himself as General Mahone.
Then, leading the column, this officer himself placed it in position in line of battle along the edge of the wood and facing the railroad.
Now, said he, you are upon the flank and rear of the enemy.
I have five brigades fighting them in front, and they are driving them.
I want you to go in and press them all you can.
Some fifty yards within the woods the swamp of a rivulet (or branch) was to be seen; beyond nothing was visible, and firing, both of artillery and infantry, was then going on. General Mahone added, When you have crossed the branch swamp you will come upon a clearing, in which, some three hundred yards farther, is the enemy's line, and they are not intrenched.
He also urged promptness in the attack.
General Hagood immediately gave the order to advance, and the men, moving in line, made their way across the swamp.
Upon arriving on the other side we found ourselves in the clearing, but the enemy still not visible.
We were under a hill, and they were upon the open plateau sufficiently far beyond to prevent the view.
The advance of the brigade had, however, evidently attracted attention, from the fire drawn in our direction.
The line had been much broken in crossing the swamp, and Hagood immediately pushed skirmishers up the hill for protection, and ordered one of his staff to accompany them and reconnoitre, while he gave his personal assistance to Captain Malony in getting the line of battle rapidly re-formed.
He assisted the adjutant, instead of himself going to reconnoitre, because, from the report of a courier who had gone up the hill while the skirmishers were forming, he thought there was some danger of being himself assailed where he was, and his men were so disorganized at the moment as to be in no condition to repel an attack. 
In a few minutes the brigade was formed, and the report coming at the same time from the skirmishers that the enemy was but a short distance ahead of them, and only in rifle-pits, thus confirming General Mahone's statement, Hagood, cautioning his men to move only at a quick-step till he himself gave the order to charge, moved his brigade forward.
He had dismounted, and, placing himself in front of the centre, to steady the men and repress excitement, moved backward in front of the line for a short distance as if on drill.
Himself halting before reaching the crest of the hill, the line passed, and he followed, with his staff, behind the right of the 21st regiment.
The 25th was on the left of the 21st, and the other three regiments on its right.
As soon as the brigade became visible ascending the hill a rapid fire was opened upon it, to which in reply not a shot was fired; but, moving forward steadily at quick time, with arms at right shoulder shift, as we approached the line of enemy's pits they broke from them and fled.
With one accord a battle-yell rang out along our line, and the men, as if by command, broke into double-quick in pursuit.
At the same moment General Hagood discovered that the line in front of us had only been an intrenched skirmish line, though so heavy as to have deceived his skirmishers into the notion that it was a line of battle, and that two hundred and fifty yards beyond was a strongly intrenched line, crowded with men and artillery, extending right and left as far as he could see, and the five Confederate attacking brigades of which General Mahone had spoken nowhere visible.
It  also appeared to him that he was moving upon a re-entering angle of the enemy's line.
In this, however, he was partially mistaken.
An examination of the field after the war showed that the enemy's line crossing the railroad from the east at this time bent immediately southward and followed its course in a comparatively straight line at some forty yards on its western side.
Later in the siege their line extended farther west.
Then, recrossing the road at a point below where we struck it, their line only bit out a piece sufficient, if he could hold and permanently intrench, to prevent its further use by us. Immediately to the right of where we struck their line a small bastioned work for field artillery was thrust forward, and our line of advance was oblique to the enemy's general line and towards its junction with the flank of this work.
Thus, in fact, we were going into a re-entering made more by the vicious direction of our advance than by the actual construction of the enemy's work.
The flank fire from the bastioned work we could not have avoided, but from our oblique attack we had also more or less of a flank fire from the straight line, which was an infantry parapet of fully five feet, with an exterior ditch eight or ten feet wide, and artillery at intervals.
Perceiving at a glance the hopelessness of assault under such circumstances, General Hagood, stopping himself, shouted again and again the command to halt; but the crash and rattle of twelve or fifteen pieces of artillery and probably twenty-five hundred rifles, which had now opened upon us at close range, drowned his voice, and the fury of battle was upon his men. Moving forward with the steady tramp of the double-quick, and dressing upon their colors, these devoted men, intent only on carrying the position before them, neither broke their alignment until it was broken by the irregular impact upon the enemy's works, nor stopped to fire their guns until their rush to obtain the parapet was repelled. 
When General Hagood saw his men thus rushing upon certain destruction, and his efforts to stop them unavailing, he felt that if they were to perish he should share their fate; and with Molony and Martin and Orderly Stoney, who were all of his staff that were with him (Moffatt and Mazyck were farther back, in discharge of their respective duties as inspector and ordnance officers), followed the advancing line.
In fifty yards Lieutenant Martin fell, shot in the knee; a few steps farther and Captain Molony fell, shot through the head, and Hagood and Stoney alone reached the works—the latter shot in the shoulder, but not disabled.
The 25th and 21st regiments being on the left, from the oblique direction of the advance, first struck the works; and while they staggered to get in the other three regiments swept on. When they reached the ditch there was from seventy-five to one hundred yards interval between the two divisions into which the brigade had broken. 
General Hagood was with Major Wilds, commanding the 21st, who was cheering on his men to renewed assault (success now being their only hope of safety), when, looking to the right, he saw a mounted Federal officer among the men on the left of the portion of the brigade to the right with a regimental color in his hands, and a confusion and parleying immediately around him that betokened approaching surrender.
The fight was still raging at Hagood's right and left; there was no cessation on our part except in the squad just around this officer,  and none whatever that was perceptible on the part of the enemy.
They had pushed out from the right and left a line behind us to cut off our retreat, and this officer (Captain Daly, of General Cutter's staff) had galloped out of a sallyport, seized a color from the hands of its bearer, and demanded a surrender.
Some officers and men surrendered, but were not carried in; others refused, but just around him ceased fighting.
General Hagood called to the men to shoot him and fall back in retreat.
They either did not hear him, or, bewildered by the surrender of part of this number, failed to obey.
It was a critical moment, and demanded instant and decided action.
In a few minutes the disposition to surrender would have spread, and the whole brigade have been lost.
Making his way across the intervening space as speedily as he could, exposed to a regular fire by file from the enemy's line scarce thirty yards off, and calling to his men to fall back, which they did not do, General Hagood approached the officer and demanded the colors, and that he should go back within his own lines, telling him he was free to do so. He commenced arguing the hopelessness of further struggle, and pointed out the line in our rear.
Hagood cut him short and demanded a categorical reply—yes or no. Daly was a man of fine presence, with long, flowing beard, and sat with loosened rein upon a noblelooking bay that stood with head and tail erect, and flashing eye and distended nostrils, quivering in every limb with excitement, but not moving in his tracks.
In reply to this abrupt demand the rider raised his head proudly, and decisively answered No!
Upon the word General Hagood shot him through the body, and as he reeled from the saddle upon one side sprang into it from the other, Orderly Stoney seizing the flag from his falling hands.
There was no thought of surrender now; the yell from the brigade following the act and ringing out above the noise of battle told their commander that they were once more in hand, and would go now wherever ordered—whether to the front or rear.
Shouting to them to face about, Hagood led them at a run against the line in his rear, Stoney holding aloft in the front the recaptured flag, which he had torn from its staff.
This line melted before our charge; but the fire was terrific, after breaking through it, until the shelter of the valley of the branch was reached.
Upon its margin a fragment from a schrapnel shell tore open the loin of the horse upon which Hagood rode; and struggling as he fell he kicked Lieutenant William Taylor, of the 7th battalion, upon the head, rendering him for the time so confused that he had to be led from the field by one of his men. This gallant young officer had a few days before rejoined his command with an unhealed wound received at Drury's Bluff. 
This ended the fighting for the possession of the Weldon road.
The Confederate losses had been very insignificant until to-day, and now it was confined principally to our brigade.
Grant had lost five thousand men, but he had the road. A few days afterwards Hancock, with eight thousand men, was despatched southward from this point to tear up the track.
A. P. Hill and Hampton met and defeated him at Reams's Station, with the loss of two field-batteries and between twenty-five hundred and three thousand men. 
A week afterwards, in a conversation in General Lee's presence, General A. P. Hill stated to Hagood that on the morning of the 21st he was misinformed by  his scouts as to the position and condition of the enemy's works, believing that the point upon which Hagood was sent was the left of their line, and that they had no other work down the railroad.
He also added that the haziness of the morning prevented his ascertaining his error until Hagood's attack developed it. General Mahone also said to Hagood that he shared the same misapprehension, but insisted that if the other five brigades had attacked with the same vigor that Hagood's did, we would have won. It seemed that after driving the enemy's skirmish line from the pits, out of which Hagood's men marched them, they stopped, and the heavy fusilade which made Mahone think they were driving the enemy was from a stationary line firing at long range.
The frankness and freedom with which these two distinguished officers took the blame of the blunder upon themselves greatly relieved General Hagood, for he feared that this affair, in the misapprehension to which it would be subjected, would be similar to the assault of the 24th of June at the City Point road.
It was, however, generally correctly understood in the army, and apparently not misunderstood by the public.
Both Generals Lee and Beauregard were on the field, and the latter next day sent Hagood word through General Hoke that, had it been in his power, he would have promoted him before leaving it. He also, through his adjutant, called for a written report of the incident of the flag.
This was briefly given and forwarded.
Some months afterwards General Cooper, Adjutant-General at Richmond, very kindly sent to General Hagood an official copy of the indorsements made on the report, then on file in his office. 
They were as follows: 
 Headquarters, Department N. C. And so. Va., near Petersburg, August 23d, 1864. 
Respectfully forwarded through General R. E. Lee to his Excellency President Davis for his information.
Such an act of gallantry as herein described, and of devotion to one's flag, reflects the highest credit on the officer who performs it, and it should be held up to the army as worthy of imitation under similar circumstances.
Brigadier-General Hagood is a brave and meritorious officer, who had distinguished himself already at Battery Wagner and Drury's Bluff, and participated actively in battles of Wanbottom Church and Petersburg, on the 16th and 17th of June last.
I respectfully recommend him for promotion at the earliest opportunity.
Attention is also called to General Hagood's recommendation of his orderly, private J. D. Stoney, for a commission.
I feel assured he is deserving of it. G. T. Beauregard, Genl.  
 Headquarters, A. N. V., August 24th, 1864. 
Respectfully forwarded. R. E. Lee, Genl. 
 September 1st, 1864. Bureau A. And I.-Gen., appointment Office. 
Respectfully submitted to Secretary of War. By order. E. A. Palfrey, A. A. G. 
Respectfully submitted, as requested, to notice of the President. J. A.  Seddon, Secretary of War.  
There are two modes of recognizing distinguished service: one by promotion, the other by announcement in orders.

 Charleston, S. C., September 25th, 1864. 
General,—The President has ordered me (verbally) to repair to Charleston and await further orders.
Meanwhile to inquire into the difficulties between yourself and Brigadier-General Ripley, and to examine the condition of the defences and troops at and about Charleston, assisted by my Chief-Engineer Colonel D. B. Harris, and Chief-Inspector Lieutenant-Colonel A. Roman.
The former is then to remain on duty with you until further orders, as Inspector of Fortifications and adviser in that branch of the service. 
You will please issue accordingly all necessary orders to carry out the views of the President.

Captain,—General Beauregard directs that you take temporary command of this Post, and forward to the Army of Tennessee, at or in the vicinity of Lafayette, Ga., all the officers and men returning to the army, placing each detachment in command of a suitable officer, whose duty it will be to divide the command among the officers accompanying him. 
If convenient to the route, these commands ought to go via the iron-works at Round-top Mountain.
There they can procure rations, and learn where the army is. 
You will call upon Major T. W. Francis, Commissary, to supply the men with rations. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, A. R.  Chisolm, A. D. C. 
 Jacksonville, Ala., Oct. 11th, 1864. Major T. W. Francis, Commissary at Jacksonville, Ala.: 
Major,—General Beauregard has assigned Captain W. J. Bethune to duty as temporary commander of this post, and has directed him to call upon you to supply rations for men returning to and coming from the Army of Tennessee. 
He desires you to give him prompt assistance, so that no time may be lost by men remaining here. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, A. R.  Chisolm, A D. C.  
 Jacksonville, Ala., Oct. 11th, 1864. Captain Edward W. Hall, A. A. G.: 
Captain,—General Beauregard being informed that you are on your way to rejoin the army, and that you have not sufficiently recovered from your recent wound to travel, he directs that you will remain on temporary duty at this post from this date, and act as post adjutant. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, A. R.  Chisolm, A. D. C. 
 Jacksonville, Ala., Oct. 11th, 1864. Captain Elias Kenady, Jacksonville, Ala.: 
Captain,—As you are the nearest quartermaster to this post, General Beauregard directs that you make arrangements with the post commandant here to furnish what may be required from your department for the post, and for the purpose of forwarding all men arriving here on their way to and from the army.

The General further directs that you will place yourself in communication with Colonel Forney, and give him what assistance he may desire. 
He will probably require guards for stores. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, A. R.  Chisolm, A. D. C. 
 Jacksonville, Ala., Oct. 12th, 1864. Col. W. H. Forney, Jacksonville, Ala.: 
Colonel,—General Beauregard desires that you would temporarily take command of this post.
The present commanding officer he directs that you employ as your assistant.
For instructions I refer you to my note of the 11th instant to Captain Bethune. 
The General further desires that you will, by means of a quick line of couriers, place yourself in communication with Brigadier-General Elzey, at Round Mountain Iron-works, by which route he thinks for the present it would  be best to send men rejoining the army.
He wishes that line connected with the one in operation to Blue Mountain. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, A. R.  Chisolm, A. D. C. 
 Headquarters, Army of Tennessee, in the field, Oct. 12th, 1864. 
To the Officer Commanding the United States Forces at Resaca, Ga.: 
Sir,—I demand the immediate and unconditional surrender of the post and garrison under your command, and, should this be acceded to, all white officers and soldiers will be paroled in a few days.
If the place is carried by assault no prisoners will be taken. 
Most respectfully, your obedient servant, J. B. Hood, Genl. Official. S. M.  Dayton, Aide-de-Camp. 
 Jacksonville, Ala., Oct. 12th, 1834. Genl. Samuel Cooper, Adjt. and Insp.-Genl., Richmond, Va.: 
General,—I arrived at Newnan, Ga., on the 7th inst., where, having ascertained that General Hood's headquarters were at Cedar Town, and that his army was moving northwestwardly, after destroying in the vicinity of Marietta five or six miles of the railroad from Atlanta to Chattanooga, I left at once to join him, overtaking him at Cave Spring on the evening of the 9th inst. 
I was there informed by him that General Sherman, having hastily advanced from Atlanta with five corps, amounting to about forty thousand (40,000) men, leaving one corps to guard his fortifications, he (General Hood) had determined to draw Sherman's forces still farther north by attempting to break up the railroad between Kingston and Resaca, and again between Resaca and Dalton.
To effect the first of these objects he proposed crossing to the north side of the Coosa River, about twelve (12) miles below Rome (which is still occupied by one division of the enemy), and then to cross the Oostenaula about the same distance above that town.
After destroying the road as contemplated, if he could not obtain the immediate surrender of Resaca, commanding the railroad bridge over the Oostenaula, he designed recrossing to the north side on his pontoon-bridge above Rome, moving thence to destroy the road between Resaca and Dalton.
He proposed meanwhile to guard well the crossing of the Coosa and Oostenaula rivers, so as to protect his right flank and rear from an attack by Sherman. 
Not being sufficiently well acquainted with the nature of the country referred to, and not having yet assumed command of my new department, I advised General Hood not to carry out his first project, unless confident of being able to recross the Oostenaula above Rome before General Sherman could concentrate superior forces against him, or could endanger his communications.
He readily assented to this suggestion. 
It was also determined that, as a success was necessary to keep up the present buoyant spirit of the Army of Tennessee, a battle should not be fought unless  with positive advantage on our side of numbers and position, or unless the safety of the army required it. 
Under these circumstances, being still unprovided with a staff, baggage, and horses (left in Virginia when I was ordered to Charleston), and wishing to confer (before assuming command) with Lieutenant-General Richard Taylor relative to the condition of his department and to his ability to co-operate with General Hood in the present campaign, being desirous, moreover, of arranging matters necessarily connected with the change of base from Jonesboroa, Ga., to Jacksonville, Ala., I repaired to this place for the objects stated, hoping to be able to return to the front in time for a battle, should one occur; but, to be certain of doing so, I instructed General Hood to keep me advised of the movements of the enemy.
I expect, nevertheless, to rejoin him in a few days. 
I desire that, until further notice, all letters and communications should be addressed to me at this place, whence they will be forwarded to my headquarters, wherever they may be temporarily located. 
I remain, General, very respectfully, your obedient servant, G. T. Beauregard, Genl. 
 Jacksonville, Ala., Oct. 13th, 1864. Genl. J. B. Hood, Comdg. Army of Tenn., etc.: 
General,—General Beauregard, upon arriving here, found there was no post commandant or other officers on duty here; he therefore has ordered the following named wounded and invalid officers on temporary duty until other arrangements can be made: 
Colonel W. H. Forney, 10th Alabama, of General Lee's army, as commandant of the post; Captain Edward Hall, A. A. G., of Taylor's brigade, Army of Tennessee, as post adjutant;; Lieutenant William Anderson, acting commissary, 57th Georgia regiment, Mercer's brigade, Cleburne's division, Army of Tennessee, as acting commissary; Assistant-Surgeon R. B. Harris, 57th Georgia regiment, Mercer's brigade, Cleburne's division, Army of Tennessee, as post surgeon. 
There is neither a quartermaster nor commissary regularly stationed here, and both are much needed. 
Colonel Forney is sending forward the men as fast as they arrive.
Those without shoes he has detained to act as guards until some one authorized to issue shoes, etc., from the quartermaster's department can be sent here. 
About seven hundred men were returned, and started, via Round Mountain, yesterday; many more are said to be en route here. 
General B. suggests that it would be well for you to send an engineer officer to this place to locate some field-works for the protection of the depot established here. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant, A. R.  Chisolm, A. D. C.

  Headquarters, Military Division of the West, Jacksonville, Oct. 22d, 1864. Major-Genl. M. L. Smith, Chief-Engineer:  
General,—I am just in receipt of a note from General Beauregard, in which he expresses the desire that you shall join him at Gadsden, as soon as practicable, for conference.
I shall leave to join the General at Gadsden in the morning.  Geo. Wm.  Brent, Col., and A. A. G.    
  Gadsden, Ala., Oct. 22d, 1864. Lieut.-Genl. R. Taylor, Comdg. Dept., etc., Jacksonville, Ala.:  
General,—In order to save time, I desire you should attend as soon as possible to the following matters: 
Order Forrest and Roddy to enter as soon as practicable into communication, by letter or otherwise, with General Hood at some point between Guntersville and Decatur, Ala., and to remain subject to his orders for the present. 
If necessary, General Hood will order General Jackson's division to report to you meanwhile for the protection of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, and of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad.
You must call at once on the Governors of Alabama and Mississippi for all the assistance possible for the protection of those two roads, establishing garrisons at Corinth, Bear Creek Bridge, and other important points on those roads, which should be strengthened also by the construction of such block-houses and field-works as may be required.
Major-General Smith will be further instructed upon the subject. 
I desire to see you here, with Major-General Smith, as soon as practicable. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  G. T. Beauregard, Genl.    
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, in the field, Oct. 23d, 1864. Lieut.-Genl. Richard Taylor, Comdg., etc., Selma, Ala.:  
General,—General Beauregard directs me to call your attention to the following points and instructions which he desires to be carried out:  
1st.
The railroad from Jacksonville to Selma will be abandoned as a means of supplying the Army of Tennessee, the base having been transferred from Jacksonville to Tuscumbia.
Henceforth the lines of communication for army supplies to that point will be the Mobile and Ohio, and the Memphis and Charleston Railroads.
These roads will be put forthwith in complete running order, and will be supplied with rolling-stock. 
2d.
Block-houses and small field-works should be constructed at proper points on these roads for the protection of bridges and trestle-works.
They should be large enough to hold one or more companies of infantry.
Major-General Smith, Chief-Engineer, has been directed to confer with you on the subject of field-works, etc. Negro prisoners, as far as practicable, should be employed on the block-houses and field-works. 
3d.
You will as soon as possible place suitable garrisons at Corinth and Bear Creek.
A suitable commander should be sent at once to Corinth.
General Beauregard would suggest the name of Brigadier-General D. W. Adams, but the selection of a proper commandant he leaves to your judgment. 
Colonel J. C. Reid has been ordered to assume command, temporarily, of the post at Tuscumbia, until you can find a more suitable person. 
4th. Major-General Forrest, as soon as practicable, after executing his present instructions, will promptly report to General J. B. Hood, in Middle Tennessee, for orders. 
5th.
The railroad from Selma to Jacksonville will be completed as early as practicable, as heretofore ordered; but the rolling-stock will be gradually reduced to the amount used thereon prior to the movement of General Hood's army from Jonesboroa. 
6th.
All men returning to the army should be sent to Tuscumbia.
Before, however, being forwarded, they should be properly organized and sent under proper officers.
Until the Army of Tennessee shall have passed the Tennessee River the troops returning may be detained to garrison Corinth.
All the returning troops now at Oxford will be sent as above directed. 
7th.
The iron between Memphis and Corinth should be removed, commencing at or near Memphis.
The road should be destroyed as effectively as possible to prevent its use by the enemy against us. 
8th.
Write to their excellencies Governors Watts and Clark to furnish you with State troops and militia to cover our railroad lines of communication. 
9th.
A line of couriers has been established at Oxford to communicate with the rear of the army, either by this place (Gadsden) or Blue Mountain. 
I have the honor to be, General, respectfully, your obedient servant,  Geo. Wm.  Brent, Col., and A. A. G.    
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, in the field, Gadsden, Ala., Oct. 23d, 1864. Genl. J. B. Hood, Comdg. Army of Tenn.:  
General,—General Beauregard desires that you will have prepared for the signature of Major-General Cheatham an address to the citizens of Tennessee, stating substantially as follows:  
That Cheatham's veteran corps, in connection with the gallant corps of the chivalrous Forrest, has entered upon the soil of Tennessee to enable her sons to redeem themselves from the yoke of a vile oppressor, who has violated the integrity of her independence by a cruel and lawless invasion of her territory.
That he earnestly invokes their co-operation in the glorious work of her redemption; that he calls upon them to give him and his brave troops all their aid in destroying effectually the lines of the enemy's communication and breaking up his sources of supplies, while the main body of the Army of Tennessee is engaged in the similar work of destruction from Atlanta to Chattanooga. 
The General desires that this address be printed at Huntsville, or elsewhere if possible, and be freely distributed within the enemy's lines.
If it cannot be printed, let as many copies as practicable be manuscripted and posted at all prominent points. 
The above is designed as merely indicating the character of the address, leaving all other matters to your judgment.
It cannot be printed at Jacksonville as first proposed. 
Governor Harris has not arrived at these headquarters. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  Geo. Wm.  Brent, Col., and A. A. G.

  Headquarters, Military division of the West, Tuscumbia, Nov. 4th, 1864. General J. B. Hood, Comdg., etc., etc.:  
General,—General Beauregard has directed me to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 3d inst., with the copies of your telegrams to the government.
 He however expresses the hope that you will soon be able to comply with his request contained in his communication of the 30th ultimo.
A summary statement from each corps commander would answer the purpose. 
A brief report of your plan of operations from this point, for the information of the government, he deems important, and requests that you will forward the same as early as practicable. 
I have the honor to enclose copy of despatch sent on yesterday to MajorGen-eral Forrest. 
He has also been advised to-day of your movement, and ordered to report to you. 
I am, General, respectfully, your obedient servant,  Geo. Wm.  Brent, Col., and A. A. G.    
  Richmond, Va., Nov. 7th, 1864: via Meridian. Genl. J. B. Hood:  
No troops can have been sent by Grant or Sheridan to Nashville.
The latter has attempted to reinforce the former, but Early's movements prevented it. That fact will assure you as to their condition and purposes.
The policy of taking advantage of the reported division of his forces, where he cannot reunite his army, is too obvious to have been overlooked by you. I therefore take it for granted that you have not been able to avail yourself of that advantage during this march northward from Atlanta.
Hope the opportunity will be offered before he is extensively recruited.
If you keep his communications destroyed, he will most probably seek to concentrate for an attack on you. But if, as reported to you, he has sent a large part of his force southward, you may first beat him in detail, and subsequently, without serious obstruction or danger to the country in your rear, advance to the Ohio River.  Jefferson  Davis.    
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, Tuscumbia, Nov. 9th, 1864. Major-Genl. Smith, Chief-Engineer, etc.:  
General,—I telegraphed you yesterday relative to certain reconnoissances about Savannah,
Savannah, Tennessee, on the Tennessee River. which it is thought should be made immediately, as a change of base from this place to Purdy may become necessary at any moment.
Should the roads to Savannah and the nature of the banks of the river in that vicinity not be favorable to crossing and to the command of the river, a position higher or lower should be selected at once.
The west bank should be more elevated than the opposite one, to give greater command over the approaches to the point of crossing, which should be in a re-entering of the river, if practicable, in order that our batteries may have a cross-fire on those approaches. 
I send you herewith the sketch of a detached floating boom armed with a torpedo, to prevent the enemy's gunboats from passing our batteries at night.
Torpedoes should be anchored also in the open spaces between the booms—say  one to each space.
These booms, triangular in shape, about 40 feet in length by about 20 feet base, should be made of five longitudinal pieces and five or six cross ones strongly halved into and on top of the former. 
The booms should be anchored across the stream about forty feet apart, from centre to centre; a second row, breaking openings, should be anchored about one hundred feet below the first row. Then, if the channel at high-water be eight hundred feet broad, each row would contain twenty booms and forty torpedoes. 
The torpedoes should be about six feet below the surface of the water all stages of the river.
The booms should be firmly anchored, with the apex of the triangle up-stream.
I do not object to a proper modification of the above plan of boom. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  G. T. Beauregard, Genl.    
  Headquarters, Military Department of the West, Tuscumbia, Nov. 10th, 1864. Genl. J. B. Hood, Comdg., etc., etc.:  
General,—General Beauregard instructs me to say that he desires you would instruct Generals Wheeler, Roddy, and Forrest to furnish, as early as practicable, the number of scouts they have employed; where operating; how employed, organized, and supplied with provisions; how often they report; and whether under charge of a special officer. 
He desires that all independent scouts shall forthwith report to some responsible officer, and that all scouts operating in rear of the front line of the army (cavalry included) shall at once report to their proper commands, as only regularly organized companies should be kept in rear of such lines to collect information and maintain order.
And they should be supplied with rations and forage in some systematic way, to prevent depredations on private property.
The system of roving or independent scouts he regards as detrimental, and should be abandoned. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  Geo. Wm.  Brent, Col., and A. A. G.

General Beauregard desires to know whether the negroes at work on the railroad and fortifications in and about Corinth are the same captured by your command in Georgia; and, if so, what arrangement has been made for medical attendance upon them. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  Geo. Wm.  Brent, Col., and A. A. G.    
  Headquarters, Army of Tennessee, in the field, Nov. 12th, 1864.  
Colonel,—I have just been informed by General Stewart that General Beauregard would review his corps at 11 A. M. to-day.
I am surprised that one so familiar with the rule that all orders, whether for review and inspection, or whatever kind, relating to this army, must pass through me, its Commanding General, should have overlooked it in this instance. 
The propriety of a review at the time and place is, in my opinion, more than questionable, as it affords the enemy in our immediate vicinity an opportunity, through spies or disaffected persons, of obtaining information in regard to our strength, of which it is desirable they should be kept as much as possible in ignorance. 
Very respectfully,  J. B.  Hood, Genl. Comdg. Col. Geo. Wm. Brent, A. A. Genl., Mil. Div. of the West.    
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, Tuscumbia, Nov. 12th, 1864.  
General,—In reply to your communication of this date relative to the review of Stewart's corps, General Beauregard directs me to say that review was designed by him as an informal one.
As he passed yesterday the headquarters of Lieutenant-General Stewart, on his way to Prospect Hill, he expressed to General Stewart a desire to review his corps, provided the weather and the condition of the ground would permit, and he, meanwhile, received no orders from you interfering therewith, of which he was to inform General Beauregard this morning about nine o'clock. 
General Stewart's notice reached General Beauregard about 9 1/2 h. this morning, and he took it for granted that General S. had informed you of the fact. 
With regard to your opinion as to the propriety of a review at this time and place, he thinks you must have a low estimate of the intelligence and judgment of your wily adversary if you suppose that at this late day he is ignorant of the position of your army and the strength of your corps. 
As soon as circumstances will permit, he desires to review, separately, the corps of Generals Cheatham and Lee, provided it will not interfere with the movements of the army. 
I am, General, respectfully, your obedient servant,  Geo. Wm.  Brent, Col., and A. A. G. Genl. J. B. Hood, Comdg., etc., etc.     
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, Tuscumbia, Ala., Nov. 14th, 1864.  
General,—I proceeded on yesterday morning to the headquarters of General J. B. Hood, to deliver the letters of Major-Generals Cobb and Smith, and also your views in relation to the positions for pontoons and batteries on the river, and the movement of the army.
On arriving at his headquarters I found that he had crossed the Tennessee, and I went in pursuit.
On reaching the north bank of the river I met Major Mason, his A. A. G., and found that General Hood was out on the lines, and being apprehensive lest I might not find him, I handed your communications and expressed your views to him. When about returning I saw General Hood, and advised him of what I had done, and communicated to him your views and wishes, among which was, that in view of the information of the concentration of the enemy's force about Decatur, Huntsville, and Pulaski, and the reported movement of Canby to Memphis, you did not desire that he would make any offensive movement until you could see him, and asking when and where it would be most convenient for you to call on him. 
He replied that he did not contemplate any such movement just then; that he was moving Cheatham's corps to the north side of the river, where he designed throwing up works which might be held against any attack of the enemy, and that Stewart's corps would be moved to the position held by Cheatham that morning on the south side, where works would also be thrown up to protect the bridge. 
He concurred also in your view that it would be best to select points for the construction of batteries on the river as far down and as far from the railroad as practicable. 
I am, General, respectfully, your obedient servant,  Geo. Wm.  Brent, Col., and A. A. G. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, Comdg., etc., etc.    
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, Tuscumbia, Ala., Nov. 15th, 1864.  
General,—As you seemed yesterday to have misunderstood my verbal communication of the 13th inst., through my Chief of Staff, I deem it of sufficient importance to communicate in writing what I had instructed him to say relative to the movement of the Army of Tennessee. 
I instructed him to tell you that in consequence of the information received the night previous—to wit: the apparent confirmation of the concentration of the bulk of Sherman's army in Middle Tennessee (at Pulaski, Huntsville, and Decatur), the arrival of Canby and part of his forces at Memphis, and the condition of Cobb's and Smith's forces at Lovejoy's Station—I desired to confer further with you before you commenced the projected movement into Middle Tennessee, now partly in process of execution; that is, Lee's corps, already in advance of Florence, and Stewart's and Cheatham's corps under orders to cross the river.
My purpose was to call again your attention, as I did yesterday, 
1st.
To the necessity of guarding well your left flank and rear, in advancing towards Lawrenceburg and Pulaski, against a sudden offensive movement of the enemy from Huntsville or Athens across the Elk River.  
2d.
To securing against the passage of the enemy's gunboats another point (about Savannah or Clifton) besides Florence for the army to recross the Tennessee, in the event of disaster. 
3d.
To giving still greater protection to Corinth and the M. and O. Railroad to that point. 
I was aware that these points had already been discussed between us, but my anxiety for the safety of the troops under your command made it incumbent on me to call again your attention to these important matters. 
I wish also to inform you that the third point mentioned may require greater time than was at first supposed necessary.
All orders for completing the defences of Corinth, repairing and prosecuting vigorously the work on the M. and C. Railroad to this place, and for repairing the M. and 0.
Railroad from Okolona to Bethel have been given, and are being carried out as rapidly as the limited means of the engineer and quartermaster's departments will permit.
It is at present reported that the railroads referred to will be completed in from fifteen to twenty days; but it is not unreasonable to suppose that the prevailing unfavorable weather will delay the work one or two weeks longer. 
General Taylor and myself will always be anxious to aid you in your present campaign with all the means at our control, but, these being limited, ample previous notice of what may be required should be given to enable us to make all necessary preparations. 
It will also give me pleasure to confer on you such powers as you may deem necessary to secure your communications, repair roads, and hasten supplies to your army, while operating in the department of General Taylor. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  G. T. Beauregard, Genl.

General,—Your letter of the 24th inst. and other letters have been delivered  by Captain Welter. General Taylor must have given you the latest news from here; nothing important has occurred since his departure.
Considering that this place is now out of danger, I shall continue to send you, as rapidly as possible, all the assistance available.
I regret not being able to send you General Forrest, as desired by the President; but General Hood stated positively, before I left Tuscumbia, that he could not spare him without endangering the success of his movement.
Moreover, Forrest would not have time now to reach you. 
I am more than ever convinced that Sherman is moving by the most direct routes to the Atlantic coast, as a base whence to attack Charleston or Savannah, or to reinforce Grant in Virginia; hence he shall avoid a battle, and will not attack any interior place which may delay his march.
From where he is now, about Sandersville, he may move equally well on Port Royal, Ossabaw Sound, or Darien.
One or two days more will decide the point he shall have selected.
Augusta can now be considered out of danger, and the movable part of its garrison can safely be transferred to Charleston or Savannah. 
I desire that General Taylor should return to his department as soon as he can be spared by you. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  G. T.  Beauregard.    
  Macon, Ga., Nov. 29th, 1864.  
General,—Your letter of the 25th inst. to General Taylor, informing him that Sherman's forces had neared Sandersville [about twenty-five miles east of  Milledgeville, in the direction of Savannah], and were marching, you think, on Savannah, was received by him at Albany and referred to me here.
General Cobb had already sent you all the disposable forces at his command, and he will continue to do so as rapidly as circumstances will permit.
You are aware, however, that we have now nearly exhausted the resources at our command.
Generals Taylor and Smith will give you all additional information on the subject which you may desire. 
Please keep me well advised, in cipher, of your movements and those of the enemy.

  Headquarters, Army of Tennessee, six miles from Nashville, on the Franklin Pike, Dec. 3d: via Burton, via Mobile, Dec. 8th, 1864.  
About 4 o'clock P. M., November 30th, we attacked the enemy at Franklin, drove them from their outer lines of temporary works into their inner works,  which they abandoned during the night, leaving their dead and wounded in our possession, and retreated rapidly to Nashville, closely pursued by our cavalry.
We captured several stands of colors and about a thousand prisoners. Our troops fought with great gallantry.
We have to lament the loss of many gallant officers and brave men. Major-General Cleburne, Brigadier-Generals John Adams, Gist, Strahl, and Grandberry were killed.
MajorGen-eral John Brown, Brigadier-Generals Canty, Manigault, Quarles, Cockerell, and Scott were wounded.

  Headquarters, Army of Tennessee, near Nashville, Dec. 11th, 1864. Hon. J. A. Seddon, Secy. of War:  
Sir,—On the 21st of November, after a delay of three weeks, caused by the bad condition of the railroad from Okolona to Cherokee, and of the dirt road from the latter point to Florence, and also by the absence of Major-General Forrest's command, this army moved forward from Florence.
Major-General Cheatham's corps, taking the road leading towards Waynesboroa, and the other two corps moving on roads somewhat parallel to this, but more to the eastward, with the cavalry under General Forrest, in their advance, and upon their right flank.
The enemy's forces were concentrated at Pulaski, with some force also at Lawrenceburg.
I hoped to be able to place our army between these forces of the enemy and Nashville; but they, hearing of our advance, evacuated Pulaski upon the 23d, our cavalry having previously driven off their forces at Lawrenceburg, and moved rapidly by the turnpike and railroad to Columbia. 
The want of a good map of the country, and the deep mud through which the army marched, prevented our coming up with the enemy before they reached Columbia; but in the evening of the 27th of November our army was placed in position in front of the enemy's works at Columbia.
During the night, however, they evacuated the town, taking position on the opposite side of the river about a mile and a half from the town, which was considered quite strong in front.
Therefore, late in the evening of the 28th of November, General Forrest, with most of his command, crossed Duck River a few miles above Columbia, and I followed early in the morning of the 29th with Stewart's and Cheatham's corps, and Johnson's division of Lee's corps, leaving the other divisions of Lee's corps in the enemy's front at Columbia.
The troops moved in right marching order, with only one battery to the corps, my object being to make a rapid march on roads parallel to the Columbia and Franklin pike, and, by placing  the troops across this pike at or near Spring Hill, to cut off that portion of the enemy.
The cavalry engaged the enemy near Spring Hill about mid-day, but their trains were so strongly guarded that they were unable to break through them.
About 4 P. M. our infantry forces, Major-General Cheatham in the advance, commenced to come in contact with the enemy about two miles from Spring Hill, through which the Columbia and Franklin pike passed.
The enemy were at this time moving along this pike, with some of their troops formed on the flank of their column to protect it. Major-General Cheatham was ordered at once to attack the enemy vigorously, and get possession of this pike; and, although these orders were frequently and earnestly repeated, he made but a feeble and partial attack, failing to reach the point indicated.
Darkness soon came on, and, to our mortification, the enemy continued moving along this road, almost in ear-shot, in hurry and confusion, nearly the entire night.
Thus was lost the opportunity for striking the enemy for which we had labored so longthe best which this campaign has offered, and one of the best afforded during the war. Major-General Cheatham has frankly confessed the great error of which he was guilty, and attaches all the blame to himself.
While his error lost so much to the country, it has been a severe lesson to him, by which he will profit in the future.
In consideration of this, and of his previous conduct, I think it is best that he should retain, for the present, the command he now holds.
Before daylight next morning (November 30th) the entire column of the enemy had passed us, retreating rapidly towards Franklin, burning many of their wagons.
We followed as fast as possible, moving by the Columbia and Franklin pike; Lieutenant-General Lee, with the two divisions, and trains and artillery, moving from Columbia by the same road.
The enemy made a feint of making a stand on the hills about four (4) miles from Franklin, in the direction of Spring Hill; but as soon as our forces commenced deploying to attack them, and extending to outflank them on their left, they retired slowly to Franklin.
This created a delay of some hours.
We, however, commenced advancing on Franklin, and attacked the place about 4 P. M. with the corps of Generals Stewart and Cheatham, Johnson's division of Lee's corps becoming engaged later.
We carried the enemy's entire line of temporary works, but failed to carry the interior line. 
During the night I had our artillery brought forward and placed in position to open upon them in the morning, but the enemy retreated rapidly during the night on Nashville, leaving their dead and wounded in our hands.
We captured about a thousand (1000) prisoners and several stands of colors.
Our loss in officers was severe: the names of the general officers I have already given by telegraph.
Our entire loss was four thousand five hundred (4500). We continued our march towards Nashville, and on the 2d of December our army took its present position in front of and about two miles from the city. 
Lieutenant-General Lee's corps, which constitutes our centre, rests upon the Franklin pike, with General Cheatham upon his right and General Stewart upon his left.
Our line is strongly intrenched, and all the available positions upon our flanks and in rear of them are now being fortified with strong, selfsupporting, detached works, so that they may easily be defended should the  enemy move out upon us. The enemy still have some six thousand (6000) troops strongly intrenched at Murfreesboroa.
This force is entirely isolated, and I now have the larger part of the cavalry under General Forrest, with two brigades of infantry, in observation of these forces, and to prevent their foraging upon the country.
Should this force attempt to leave Murfreesboroa, or should the enemy attempt to reinforce it, I hope to be able to defeat them. 
I think the position of this army is now such as to force the enemy to take the initiative.
Middle Tennessee, although much injured by the enemy, will furnish an abundance of commissary stores, but ordnance and certain quartermaster stores will have to come from the rear, and therefore it is very important that the railroad should be repaired at once from Cherokee to Decatur.
The cars can now run from here to Pulaski, on the Tennessee and Alabama Railroad, and we have sufficient rolling-stock, captured from the enemy, to answer our purposes.
I will endeavor to put the road in order from Pulaski to Decatur as soon as possible. 
As yet I have not had time to adopt any general system of conscription, but hope soon to do so, and to bring into the army all men liable to military duty. 
Some fifteen thousand (15,000) of the enemy's Trans-Mississippi troops are reported to be moving to reinforce the enemy here.
I hope this will enable us to obtain some of our troops from that side in time for the spring campaign, if not sooner.

  Headquarters, District South Carolina, Pocotaligo, Dec. 12th, 1864.  
General,—I have the honor to forward for your information a summary return of the troops along the line of the railroad from this point to the Savannah River, exclusive of certain cavalry forces commanded by Brigadier-General Young and Colonel C. J. Colcock, from whom no reports have been received. 
The hurried manner in which these troops have been collected—many of them having never been in the field before, and nearly all of them assembled in detachments—will account for the separation of the several organizations composing the entire command.
Steps will be taken at once to secure a more perfect organization, and to collect the scattered detachments of infantry, cavalry, and artillery under their immediate commanders. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,  Sam.  Jones, Major-Genl. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, Comdg., etc., Charleston.

W. J.  Hardee, Lieut.-Genl.    
  Richmond, April 6th, 1875. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, New Orleans:  
General,—Your letter of March 30th was received last evening.
I have not seen Colonel Jones's book on The Siege of Savannah in 1864, to which you allude, but will get it at an early day. 
I have heard so many misstatements from time to time in regard to this event, that the seizure of my papers and other effects in upper South Carolina by a troop of marauding Federal cavalry just after the war, which has prevented me from being able to give any statement of the affair which I could authenticate by documents, has always been a matter of sincere regret; and I have not thought that any other kind of statement would be worthy of consideration.
My recollections, however, are very clear in regard to circumstances, and my official position gave me peculiar advantages for knowing the opinions of the leading officers, and the plans determined on from time to time; yet I am unable to give exact dates, or to arrange the occurrences in the proper order. 
Enclosed I send you a few papers for your perusal, which will fix some dates, and will show you what were the relations between General Hardee and myself, and also will throw some light on his intentions and views. 
I happened to be at the councils of war held at both your visits to Savannah, the first about the 7th or 10th of December, and the last about the 17th, and in the absence of Colonel Roy, A. G. for General Hardee, acted as secretary of the meetings. 
The first council was composed of yourself, with Generals Hardee, McLaws, Wright, and G. W. Smith.
At the last one of the major-generals was absent, but I cannot state positively which one.
I wrote at your dictation the general plan of operations, which was substantially followed out in the orders issued by Colonel Roy, by order of General Hardee. 
Your recollection is somewhat in error in regard to the construction of the bridge across the Savannah River.
It was on your first visit that the question of providing a means of evacuation was discussed, as you will see by referring to the note of General Hardee.
By the 13th the bridge was completed across the main channel, and the causeway was made over Hutchinson's Island.
The completion of the bridge was delayed by the destruction of rice boats, collected by my orders at different points on the river, by the cavalry we had on the South Carolina shore, who thought that they were being collected by the enemy to transport his force across.
When you returned, about the 17th, you found the  bridge yet incomplete, and I well remember the anxiety you expressed when I stated the condition of affairs in consequence of this blunder.* * * 
The bridge work was done by a company of engineer troops, under the command of Captain Robert M. Stiles; and the causeway by a force under Mr. Daniel Callahan, previously a railroad contractor, then in the service of the Engineer Department of Confederate States.
Most efficiently did these gentlemen, and the officers and men acting with them, do their duty. 
The bridge and causeway were located by myself in person immediately after my arrival at Savannah, and I received no suggestions from any except yourself as to the manner of construction.
My recollection of these suggestions is the same as your own, except that they were made on your first and not on your last visit. 
On or about the 13th of December General Hardee thought seriously of evacuation, without awaiting the completion of the bridge; at least such was my impression from our consultations, and this view his note of the 13th, urging the construction of a floating wharf on the north side of Hutchinson's Island, seems to corroborate.
We were certainly in a precarious situation, but I urged that the enemy had not yet shown the disposition to act in the direction which it had previously been agreed on must be the signal for our departure, and that we might yet perfect our communications in time.
Most gallantly and soldierly did he examine each question, take every responsibility, and make his dispositions for action, when the time came.
In making this statement I would not in any manner detract from his noble fame.
He may have had information that he did not care to impart to me; and while I communicate my thoughts on the subject to you, I do not desire to put this idea of his (which could only have been executed at such fearful risks) on record. 
The memoranda instructing me to prepare orders for the evacuation of Charleston, and notes for the disposition of his force at other times, made in his own hand, which you will doubtless recognize, will show that the clearness of the instructions I had drawn up for him at Savannah was sufficiently satisfactory for him to trust me in the same line of duty again, though previously I had scarcely done more than to put your orders in form, and I believe that I retained his confidence during his life. 
Excuse a hastily written letter.
I thought it best to write at once; and if any points might suggest themselves to you on which you might wish to compare your recollection of events with mine, I would at all times be ready to write all that I can remember. 
The scraps I enclose are the only ones now in my possession, I think, in which General Hardee used his own pen; and as they are of little value to others, and I prize them as relics of the past, I will be obliged to you to return them to me, after making any copy or memoranda from them that you wish. 
Very sincerely and respectfully yours, etc.,  Jno. G.  Clarke.    
  Charleston, S. C., Dec. 23d, 1864. To Genl. S. Cooper, Adjt.-Genl., Richmond, Va.:  
Unless Wheeler's cavalry of twelve so-called brigades can be properly organized  into divisions under good commanders, a large portion of it had better be dismounted forthwith.
Its conduct in front of the enemy and its depredations on private property render it worse than useless.
I regret being unable to recommend for promotion any of General Wheeler's brigadiers; but hope that if two or three available Major-Generals cannot be had, promotions might be made for the purpose indicated from General Hampton's cavalry.
Brigadier-General Dearing, of that command, attracted my attention last summer as a promising officer.
I would be glad to have him.  G. T.  Beauregard.    
Telegram.  Montgomery, Ala., Dec. 25th, 1864. Genl. G. T. Beauregard:  
Have no official tidings from Army of Tennessee; but am apprehensive that some reverse has taken place.
General S. D. Lee telegraphs from Florence, December 23d: Will be in Okolona or Columbus in a few days, and will be glad to have your views in relation to recent events in Tennessee.
I have telegraphed him for an explanation.  Geo. Wm.  Brent, Col., and A. A. G.    
  Headquarters, D. W. La., Shreveport, Jan. 5th, 1865.  
Colonel,—Your letter of the 3d inst., relating to the crossing of troops to the east bank of the Mississippi River, and enclosing copies of correspondence on that subject, has been received.
In reply I have the honor to state that in my opinion it is impracticable at this season of the year to cross any considerable body of men. The following are some of the reasons upon which this opinion is based: 
When the attempt was made last summer, under the direction of Lieutenant-General Taylor, the roads leading to the Mississippi River were practicable for all arms of the service, and the country through which the movement was made abounded in forage and provisions, a concentration of the troops with a view of forcing or surprising a passage of the river induced a corresponding concentration of the enemy's gunboats.
After making renewed attempts to effect a crossing General Taylor abandoned the enterprise as hopeless, expressing the opinion that it was impracticable.
The vigilance of the enemy, and their means of resisting the crossing were so great that Major-General Wharton, commanding the cavalry, after a careful reconnoissance made use of the illustration, that a bird, if dressed in Confederate gray, would find it difficult to fly across the river.
The only feasible plan to have crossed at that time would have been to have crossed the army in small squads at various points, leaving it virtually without organization, and making it equivalent, in the disaffected condition of the troops at that time, to a disorganization and dispersion of two-thirds of the army.
If it were impracticable when Lieutenant-General Taylor so justly pronounced it so, the difficulties are greatly increased at this time. 
The country is exhausted of its provisions and forage.
The swamps are utterly impracticable for an army.
The country would not support the troops,  and provisions cannot be carried with them.
The Washita River being now high, any troops occupying the country east of it would be isolated between the rivers and must be ultimately lost, for I have no artillery of sufficient calibre to prevent the occupation of the Washita by the enemy's ironclad vessels.
It would be impossible to place in the river the system of torpedoes suggested by General Beauregard, because the preliminary preparations would necessarily be known to the enemy, and a concentration of their gunboats would prevent the placing of even one of the frames suggested. 
In my opinion, the only means of crossing a force at any time would be to occupy two points on the bank with artillery of sufficiently heavy calibre to control the river, and to support the batteries thus established with a force sufficiently strong to prevent their capture by a land-force.
But there is not a gun in my command which would make an impression upon a heavy ironclad; and experience at Vicksburg and Port Hudson shows that even with numerous heavy batteries the Mississippi cannot be blockaded. 
These reasons induce me to think that it is entirely impracticable to cross an army over the Mississippi River at this time.
The utmost that can be done is to pass men in small squads, with the disorganization and demoralization attendant upon such a proceeding. 
I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,  S. B.  Buckner, Lieut.-Genl. Comdg. To Col. J. F. Belton, A. A. G. Headquarters, T. M. D., Shreveport, Jan. 6th, 1865. Official. H. P.  Pratt, A. A. G.    
  Headquarters, Trans-Mississippi Department, Shreveport, La., Jan. 6th, 1865.  
General,—Your letter of December 2d from Montgomery, Ala., together with a communication from Colonel Brent, Assistant Adjutant-General, of the 3d of the same month, were delivered by your aid, Captain Toutant, on the 20th ultimo.
Feeling convinced of the utter impracticability of operating during the winter season, I delayed answering your letter until Lieutenant-General Buckner, commanding District of West Louisiana, to whom it had been submitted, could be consulted.
I enclose you a copy of his reply. 
The swamps on the Mississippi are at this season impassable for conveyances; the bayous and streams all high and navigable for the enemy's gunboats; the country has been so devasted by the contending armies, and is so exhausted that the troops would require transportation for supplies for near three hundred miles from the interior to the Mississippi.
Appreciating our necessities in your department, and ardently desiring the transfer of this army to your aid, I am powerless to assist you either by crossing troops or by operating in North Arkansas and Missouri.
The country north of Red River is bare of supplies, and is at this season utterly impracticable for the operations of armies and the movement of troops.
More than two hundred miles of destitution intervene between our supplies and the enemy's works on the Arkansas, near five hundred  of desert separate our base on Red River from the productive region of Missouri.
Trusting you appreciate the difficulties under which I labor, and believe in an honest desire on my part to assist you, I remain, 
Your friend and obedient servant,  E. Kirby Smith, Genl. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, Comdg. Military Division of the West.

Telegram.  Headquarters, Spring Hill, Dec. 17th, 1864. Genl. G. T. Beauregard (Duplicate):  
In front of Nashville, on the morning of the 15th, the enemy attacked both of our flanks about the same time.
On our right they were repulsed with heavy loss, but towards evening they succeeded in driving in our infantry outpost upon our left flank.
Dispositions were made during the night to meet any renewed attack.
Early on the 16th they made a general attack on our entire line, and all their assaults were handsomely repulsed with heavy loss till 3.30 P. M., when a portion of our line to the left of the centre suddenly gave way, causing in a few moments our line to give way at all points, our troops retreating rapidly down the Franklin pike.
We lost in the day's engagement fifty pieces artillery, with several advanced wagons; our loss in killed and wounded is very small.
Our loss in prisoners is not yet fully ascertained, but is comparatively small.
Major-General Ed. Johnson and Brigadier-Generals T. B. Smith and H. R. Jackson are among them.
I still have artillery enough with the army, and am moving to the south of Duck River.  J. B. Hood, Genl.

  Richmond, Jan. 14th, 1865. Genl. G. T. Beauregard:  
Dear General,—I received your letter by Colonel Paul, and would have answered it sooner but for the great pressure of business which has been upon me for some time past.
I cannot bring my mind to the conviction that arming our slaves will add to our military strength, and the prospective and inevitable evils resulting from the measure make me shrink back from the step as only to be taken when on the very brink of the precipice of ruin.
At first I was inclined to think we might with some advantage employ negro soldiers; but the more I think of it the more disinclined I am to resort to what at best can only be regarded as a doubtful experiment.
The Yankees now do not get as many of our negroes (by absconding to them) as they did at first, because the negro knows he will be put into their armies and forced to fight.
If we force him to fight he will, as between the two sides, go to the enemy, because they offer him present stronger inducements—better food and clothing, and unlimited whiskey —and hold out to him as a reward in the future, in the event of success, a proprietary right in the soil to which he is attached.
He is made to believe by the  artful and lying Yankee that he will have a farm given him out of his master's land, and that he shall be made in every respect the equal of the white men. 
But I do not estimate him as a soldier likely to decide the fate of battles.
We have on our rolls this side of the Mississippi 401,000 men; of these there are present and effective some 175,000.
We ought easily to keep in the field an effective present force of 200,000.
This is as many as we can well feed and clothe, and is amply sufficient to prevent subjugation or even the overrunning of our territory; and the two things are widely different if our people have the pluck, fortitude, and endurance which I believe they have.
After all, what is the use of putting men into the army, whether they be white or black, if we cannot keep them there?
If we had the absentees and deserters back we would have over 300,000 effectives this side of the Mississippi, and we have on the other side nearly 70,000.
I believe we want reorganization in our army— better discipline, and, as a means to that end, better officers.
If we could feed and clothe our soldiers well, and pay them regularly—if we would officer them properly, and thus improve the morale generally, we would have numbers enough, especially if the conscription laws were firmly and impartially carried out. What we want is not new and additional legislation in army matters, so much as an energetic administration of existing laws.
There are some few necessary things to be done by law—such as consolidation, doing away with elections and promotion by seniority, a more summary mode of dropping worthless officers, the improvement of the cavalry arm (the point so forcibly dwelt upon by you), and some stringent remedy for the absenteeism of officers.
Upon all these subjects my committee has been at work and framed bills which we hope may prove efficacious if adopted by Congress.
I send you a copy of our Cavalry Bill as it passed our House.
It is now pending in the Senate.
It was drawn by General Wickham, a distinguished cavalry officer, now a member of my committee, and meets with General Wade Hampton's warm approval, as well as that of various distinguished cavalry officers whom we were able to consult.
I have written Governor Magrath concerning the condition of things in South Carolina, and would be glad if you would read the letter which I have requested him to show you. 
Very truly yours,  Wm. Porcher  miles.    
I received your telegram with reference to General J.,
General Joseph E. Johnston. and showed it to the Secretary of War.
I fear he will not be assigned to duty.  
  Meridian, Jan. 14th, 1865. By telegraph from Richmond, Jan. 12th, 1865. To Lieut.-Genl. R. Taylor:  
Yours of 9th received.
General Beauregard went to Army of Tennessee with large discretionary power.
Your name was referred to, and it would be well for you to see him. Sherman's campaign has produced bad effects on our people.
Success against his future operations is needful to animate public confidence.
Hardee requires more aid than Lee can give him. Hood's army is  the only source to which we can now look.
If you can hold Thomas in check with the addition to your forces of Generals Forrest and Roddy restored to your Department and the cavalry of Hood's army, which cannot be profitably sent to the East, then, as fast as it can be done consistently with the efficiency of the troops, the rest of Hood's army should be sent to look after Sherman.
The presence of those veterans will no doubt greatly increase efficiency of force now with Hardee.
You may show this to General Beauregard.  Jeffn. Davis.    
  by telegraph from Meridian, Jan. 15th, 1865. To President Davis, Richmond, Va.:  
My telegram of the 9th expressed the conviction that an attempt to move Hood's army at this time would complete its destruction.
Hood failed to hold Thomas in check with Forrest, Roddy, and his own cavalry, and thirty thousand troops to assist them.
To represent these thirty I have barely three thousand (3000) inefficient cavalry outside of the inadequate garrison of Mobile.
I think it would be beneficial to the cause for me to see you. 
Respectfully,  R.  Taylor, Lieut.-Genl.    
Private and confidential.  Meridian, Jan. 15th, 1865.  
General,—I send you herewith translation of a cipher telegram received late last evening (14th) from the President, with a copy of my reply thereto.
He evidently has failed to understand what I intended to convey, relative to General Hood's army, in my despatch of the 9th.
The despatch referred to was as follows: 
Have just returned from General Hood's army at Tupelo.
This army requires rest, consolidation, and reorganization.
Without these latter it will be useless anywhere.
Full power should be given to the commander at once to reorganize and consolidate.
You will observe that in this despatch I say nothing about Thomas, nor any plan of campaign; but merely refer to the condition of Hood's army, and what, in my judgment, that condition demanded.
My opinion, as expressed to you verbally, is, that unless the authorities at Richmond can be made to see the military position as it now exists, we can expect nothing but disaster during the impending campaign.
In any event, the condition of the railroads will not permit the speedy removal of troops to the East; and I believe I can effect more good to the cause by an interview with the President than in any other way. I feel it my duty to propose this, unpleasant as the trip to Richmond at this time is. I go to Mobile to-night, where I hope to hear from you. 
I am, General, most respectfully, etc.,  R.  Taylor, Lieut.-Genl. To Genl. Beauregard, Tupelo, Miss.

General,—Understanding that the transportation of Lee's corps will be ready in the morning, I desire the movement of Lee's corps from here to Augusta, via Montgomery, Macon, and Milledgeville, should commence as soon as practicable.
The troops should leave here with at least twenty (20) rounds of ammunition in their cartridge-boxes, with three days cooked rations, which should be renewed at Meridian and Montgomery, and four days at Macon.
The troops sent via Mobile will renew their rations and forage sufficient to last to Montgomery, where they will renew their supplies as well as at Macon. 
Your chief quartermaster and commissary will make the necessary arrangements for the rapid transportation of these troops to their destination.

Sherman's movements render a victory necessary to us at once, and it will require all our means to insure it. I can resist a raid without Stewart's corps, and cannot fight a battle with it against an army; and French's division is very weak, but will enable me to fully garrison Mobile and Choctaw Bluff.
The remainder of the corps should go east at once to insure success there.
We can thus save Lee's communications, raise the siege of Mobile, should it be invested, or be prepared to meet Thomas when he advances in the spring.
Last of Cheatham's corps, except furloughed men, will leave here on Wednesday.
I find upon inquiry that his Tennessee division has been furloughed until tenth, and Brantley's and Sharp's brigades until twelfth, proximo.
Will report further about artillery.  R.  Taylor, Lieut.-Genl.

General,—General Beauregard directs me to say, that, as the enemy now occupies a position between his forces and those under yourself, he deems it best that you move to the Greenville Railroad, at the nearest point, and, if forced by the enemy, take cars with your command to Abbeville, and await further orders, reporting to these headquarters your arrival and the condition of your command.
You will also report to Major-General D. H. Hill your movements, that Lieutenant-General Stewart may be kept advised.

Cookham is about eighteen miles from Columbia; Ridgeway, about twenty-five miles. 
The cavalry will necessarily follow its movements.
Delay the enemy as much as possible.
I will await at Killian's Station to hear from you. 
The General wishes you to keep him advised of the enemy's movements. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  Jno. M.  Otey, Lieut.-Col., and A. A. G.    
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, Columbia, S. C., Feb. 17th, 1865. Col. G. W. Brent, A. A. G., Augusta, Ga.:  
Colonel,—We leave here this morning, retreating in the direction of Charlotte, N. C. Chesterville, S. C., is the first point of concentration, and if it cannot be accomplished there, then Charlotte. 
Every inch of ground will be contested, and it is hoped Cheatham and Stewart may reach Charlotte at least in time to join us. Let the orders for Cheatham and Stewart to join us remain in force and be executed with the least delay practicable, by the best and shortest routes, according to existing circumstances.
The following routes might be followed by troops and trains moving to Chesterville or Charlotte, according to circumstances.
1st.
Augusta, Edgefield, Newberry, and Chesterville; the portion of the route from Newberry to Chesterville may be unsafe should the enemy advance northward from his present positions, extending along Broad River, from Columbia towards Alston.
It is not yet known how near he is to the latter place. 
2d Route: Augusta, Edgefield, 96 Depot, on Greenville and Columbia Railroad, Huntsville, on Laurensville and Newberry Railroad, Unionville, and Chesterville. 
3d Route: Washington, Abbeville, Laurensville, Unionville, and Chesterville. 
Should the concentration have to be made north of Chesterville, from Laurensville, the troops should move on the Spartanburg, thence to Yorkville and Shelby, N. C., thence to Charlotte, N. C. Provisions and forage should be collected in advance, at proper points on any of the routes indicated which may be selected or adopted.
Working parties should be sent in advance to restore roads and bridges, or construct bridges when required. 
A detachment of cavalry should accompany each column of troops, or each train moving as above referred to. The troops and trains should not be sent in small detachments, but should move regularly, as much as circumstances will permit.
By command,  Jno. M.  Otey, Lieut.-Col., and A. A. G.   
General Hampton's Plan of Concentration proposed to General Beauregard.  
  Doio, Feb. 18th, 1865.  
General,—As Sherman marches in so extended a manner, it has occurred to me that we might concentrate on one of his corps and destroy it. At present the 15th Corps is on the Winnsboroa road; the 17th on the railroad; and the other two, I suppose, across the Broad River.
The country between the two corps here is rough and inaccessible, so that if we could concentrate in front of the 17th Corps, we might defeat it before support could reach it. All the cavalry with the infantry could, I think, defeat one corps. 
I think that you might get some troops from Charleston, if they were sent by rail at once to Camden.
The road to Camden, as you are aware, turns off from the Wilmington Railroad, seven miles beyond Kingsville.
Now, if troops could come up to the junction of the Camden and Wilmington road, they could hold the crossings of the Wateree till you could get reinforcements to them.
The swamp is very wide and very difficult, even in the best weather, so that a small body of troops could check a much larger one.
I could send some cavalry to aid, if necessary.
If Sherman comes this way, you will be able to get some of your troops by Camden to the line of our march.
If, on the contrary, he moves on Charleston, the troops at the Wateree would be in the proper position.
Cheatham, too, can now join us, if you send, telling him to make forced marches.
With a few thousand more men we can cripple Sherman greatly. 
I am, very respectfully yours,  Wade  Hampton, Lieut.-Genl. Genl. Beauregard.     
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, White Oak, S. C., Feb. 19th, 1865:4.15 P. M. Lieut.-Genl. W. Hampton, Comdg. Cavalry:  
General,—General Beauregard directs me to inform you that the trains and infantry will turn off from this place, taking the road via Hazlewood and Rich Hill to Landsford, on the Catawba; thence they will move along the east bank of the Catawba to Belair; thence to Charlotte.
He desires your cavalry to conform its movements accordingly, protecting the flanks and rear of the column.
Thirty thousand (30,000) rations are still at Chesterville; if not needed by you, let the order be given for their removal. 
Should the report of the advance of the enemy in this direction be confirmed, the trains and troops will leave here about daylight in the morning. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  Jno. M.  Otey, Lieut.-Col., and A. A. G.    
  White Oak, Feb. 19th, 1865. Genl. Braxton Bragg, Wilmington, N. C.:

Not a moment must be lost in executing this order.
Leave your cavalry to protect country north of Santee River.  G. T.  Beauregard.    
  Headquarters, Petersburg, Feb. 19th, 1865. His Excellency J. C. Breckinridge, Sec. of War, Richmond, Va.:  
Sir,—The accounts received to-day from South and North Carolina are unfavorable.
General Beauregard reports from Winnsboroa that four corps of the enemy are advancing on that place, tearing up the Charlotte Railroad, and that they will probably reach Charlotte by the 24th, and before he can concentrate his troops there, He states, General Sherman will doubtless move thence on Greensboroa, Danville, and Petersburg, or unite with General Schofield at Raleigh or Weldon. 
General Bragg reports that General Schofield is now preparing to advance from Newbern to Goldsboroa, and that a strong expedition is moving against the Weldon Railroad at Rocky Mount. 
He says that little or no assistance can be received from the State of North Carolina; that exemptions and reorganizations under late laws have disbanded the State forces, and that they will not be ready for the field for some time. 
I do not see how Sherman can make the march anticipated by General Beauregard; but he seems to have everything his own way, which is calculated to  cause apprehension.
General Beauregard does not say what he proposes or what he can do. I do not know where his troops are or on what lines they are moving.
His despatches only give movements of the enemy. 
He has a difficult task to perform under present circumstances, and one of his best officers—General Hardee—is incapacitated by sickness.
I have also heard that his own health is indifferent, though he has never so stated.
Should his strength give way there is no one on duty in the Department that could replace him, nor have I any one to send there.
General J. E. Johnston is the only officer whom I know who has the confidence of the army and people, and if he was ordered to report to me I would place him there on duty.
It is necessary to bring out all our strength, and, I fear, to unite our armies, as, separately, they do not seem able to make head against the enemy.
Everything should be destroyed that cannot be removed out of the reach of Generals Sherman and Schofield. Provisions must be accumulated in Virginia, and every man in all the States must be brought out. I fear it may be necessary to abandon all our cities, and preparations should be made for this contingency. 
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,  R. E. Lee, Genl.    
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, near White Oak, S. C., Feb. 20th, 1865. Major-Genl. C. H. Stevenson, Comdg. Lee's Corps:  
General,—General Beauregard directs that you move with your command by the shortest and best route to Landsford's ford, thence to Charlotte, via Belair and Pleasant Valley.
You will await further orders at Charlotte.
Unless otherwise pressed, you will move at the rate of about twenty miles a day. He will move along the railroad, so as to be in telegraphic communication with General Hampton and the War Department.
He will probably pass the night at Chesterville, and to-morrow night at or about the railroad bridge, on the Catawba.
General Hampton has been instructed to give orders to his trains whether to accompany yours or remain under his protection. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  A. R.  Chisolm, A. D. C.

I shall move along the railroad, that I may be in telegraphic communication with yourself and the Department.
You will now have to guard your own trains, unless you prefer sending them on with General Stevenson's.  G. T.  Beauregard.

Memoranda.  
  Cheraw, Feb. 22d, 1865.  
General Hardee, after receiving General Beauregard's orders, ordering the movement to be made by rail to Greensboroa, communicated immediately with General Bragg, who informed him that he had been compelled to withdraw to the east side of the Cape Fear River, thereby leaving the railroad unprotected, and advised General Hardee that the route by Wilmington was impracticable.
General Hardee has returned to the original plan of leaving the railroad at Cheraw, and thence by overland to Greensboroa, N. C. The first troops will arrive at Cheraw to-night, and, the wagons coming through by common road, it will be five or six days before the head of the column will probably leave this point.
The distance to Greensboroa from this point is one hundred and thirty-one miles, and a good route can be had on east side of Yadkin River, and through a country that is represented to be sufficiently productive to furnish forage and commissary stores for the command.
The Yadkin is crossed on bridge at this point, and there will be no ferrying on the route.
The left flank of the column will be protected by the Yadkin River, which at this season is said to be beyond fording. 
Immediate steps will be taken to establish communications with General Beauregard by Charlotte.  W. D.  Pickett, Lieut.-Col.

He will proceed at once to effect a concentration of all available forces and make the necessary dispositions to thwart the designs of the enemy operating in those Departments.
General Beauregard, C. S. A., will report to General Johnston, commanding, etc., for assignment to such duty as he deems most advisable.

  Headquarters, armies C. S., Feb. 23d, 1865. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, Comdg., etc.:  
General,—I enclose a copy of the order assigning General Johnston to command, of which you have already been notified by telegram.
I did not need the assurance contained in your reply to my despatch, of your cheerful acquiescence and willing co-operation in a measure deemed necessary for the good of the service, knowing as I do that personal considerations have no place in your mind when the welfare of the country is concerned.
The situation of affairs in my judgment requires that we should put forth our best efforts, and I was desirous that we should not, in such an emergency, be without the assistance of the skill and ability of one of our most distinguished officers.
The reports that have reached me of the precarious condition of your health made me the more anxious lest the arduous and responsible duties that have devolved upon you should prove too great for your physical capacity, and I could not but feel apprehensive of the consequences of being deprived of your services at a critical moment.
I trust, however, that you will how be able, without injury to yourself, to afford General Johnston the full benefit of your support. 
I beg to return you my thanks for the gratification I derive from the knowledge that the course I have thought most judicious is not misunderstood or unappreciated by yourself. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,  R. E. Lee, Genl.    
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, Charlotte, N. C., Feb. 22d, 1865.  
Colonel,—General Beauregard directs that you proceed forthwith and without delay to Cheraw, S. C., with the despatch placed in your charge, and deliver it to Lieutenant-General Hardee.
Should General Hardee not have arrived there you will have the same telegraphed to him wherever he may be, if practicable, and obtain from him an acknowledgment of its receipt. 
Should you not be able to telegraph to General Hardee, you will call upon the Superintendent of the Darlington and Cheraw Railroad for a locomotive to convey you to the headquarters of that officer.
As it is all important that you reach General Hardee at the earliest practicable moment, you are authorized to call on citizens along the road for relays of horses, and, if necessary, you are authorized to resort to impressment.
Care must be taken by you to return to the owners their animals on your return. 
Citizens along the route, from Charlotte, N. C., to Cheraw, S. C., are requested to render Colonel Cook every assistance in the performance of his duty. 
Respectfully, Colonel, your obedient servant,  Jno. M.  Otey, A. A. G. Lieut.-Col. Cook, 8th Texas Cavalry, Bearer of despatch to General Hardee.

To delay the advance of the enemy, until our troops can be massed in strength sufficient to crush them, I appeal to all good and patriotic citizens in the region of country threatened by the enemy to turn out in full force all available labor, with axes, spades, and mattocks, to destroy and obstruct roads leading towards Charlotte from the south, commencing first along the roads leading to Landsford, and other crossings between that point and the railroad bridge, obstructing at the same time all roads parallel to the river within the following limits: the Pleasant Valley road, on the east, to a point opposite Landsford, thence across the Catawba to Fishing Creek; thence up said creek to the Charlotte and South Carolina Railroad.
Afterwards the work should be continued farther up the river, should the enemy threaten an advance in that direction.
The negroes should be assembled at the following points, viz.: Charlotte, Pleasant Valley, Belair, Landsford, Fort Mills, and Rock Hill, under the direction of their owners, each with six days provisions, cooking utensils, and blankets.
As far as possible the negroes will be employed at points not distant from their homes.
They will be protected by guards, and assisted by the Home Guards of the State. 
An engineer officer will be at each of the points of rendezvous to give proper direction to the labor of all who will now join us in the struggle to stay and destroy the ruthless invaders of our homes.  G. T. Beauregard, Genl.    
  Charlotte, Feb. 23d, 1865.  
I earnestly appeal to the people of North Carolina to comply promptly with this request.
I am satisfied they could render no greater service to their country.  Z. B.  Vance, Governor of North Carolina.    
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, in field, Charlotte, N. C., Feb. 24th, 1865.  
General,—General Beauregard directs that you order the headquarters' staff of the Army of Tennessee to report to General J. E. Johnston, at or near this place, as soon as possible.
The officer of the Adjutant-General's Department should be directed to bring with him such records as will be indispensable to a reorganization. 
He further orders that the troops and trains of that army (except the light  artillery), as have arrived in Augusta (accompanied by Young's division of cavalry, if not indispensable to the safety of Augusta), to move to this place via Newberry, Unionville, and Yorkville, or Chesterville.
Should movements of enemy permit it, latter route. 
The light batteries of the Army of Tennessee now at Augusta and Macon will remain at those points until further orders, reporting themselves to their headquarters. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  Jno. M.  Otey, A. A. G. Major-Genl. D. H. Hill.    
  Executive Department, Macon, Ga., Feb. 24th, 1865. Genl. G. T. Beauregard:  
The great necessity for the services of the militia of this State for a time in the agricultural field, in connection with the fact that the State is, for the first time in some ten months, free from threatened advance of the enemy upon the interior, and the further fact that they are composed of a class of men not subject to Confederate service, induce me to withdraw them for a time from your command, that they may have a furlough till the State is again threatened by the enemy. 
When needed for the defence of this State I hope to have them ready for the occasion, prepared to act with the same distinguished gallantry and patriotic devotion which has heretofore characterized their conduct upon the battlefield. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,  Jos. E.  Brown.    
  Charlotte, N. C., Feb. 24th, 1865. Genl. R. E. Lee, Petersburg, Va.:  
Telegram 22d inst. duly received.
March of Hardee's troops on this place from Cheraw was changed to railroad via Wilmington and Raleigh, on assurance of Governor Vance and General Bragg that the troops could reach here much sooner.
The fall of Wilmington, however, caused the order to be immediately countermanded by General Bragg and myself.  G. T.  Beauregard.    
  Charlotte, N. C., Feb. 24th, 1865. Genl. R. E. Lee, Petersburg, Va.:  
General Hampton reports from Chesterville yesterday evening no enemy nearer than White Oak; he is reported crossing Peay's Ferry.
A large force of cavalry moved from Hopewell Church towards Rocky Mount Ferry.
Butler is now across river.
Hampton will put himself in front of enemy, leaving one brigade to press his rear.
I have ordered Hardee to hasten his march from Cheraw.
Mail courier reports Cheatham at Jones's Ferry, on Ennoree, morning of 22d inst. I have ordered him and Stewart here via Unionville and Chesterville, where I may stop them temporarily.
Enemy's movement would seem to indicate Cheraw and Fayetteville as their present objective point.
General Taylor reports from Meridian, Miss., on 15th, twenty-five (25) transports, loaded with troops, accompanied by General Thomas, reached Vicksburg on the 13th inst.  G. T.  Beauregard.    
General J. E. Johnston's Address to his Troops.  
  Charlotte, N. C., Feb. 25th, 1865.  
General orders no. 1: 
In obedience to the orders of the General-in-chief, the undersigned assumes command of the Army of Tennessee and all troops in the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.
He takes this position with strong hope, because he will have, in council and in the field, the aid of the high talents and skill of the distinguished general whom he succeeds. 
He exhorts all absent soldiers of the Army of Tennessee to rejoin their regiments and again confront the enemy they so often encountered in Northern Georgia, and always with honor.
He assures his comrades of the army who still are with their colors, that the confidence in their discipline and valor which he has publicly expressed is undiminished.  J. E. Johnston, Genl.    
  Charlotte, N. C., Feb. 26th, 1865:7.30 A. M. Genl. Braxton Bragg, Rocky Fish Creek, near Wilmington, N. C.:  
Should enemy move as supposed the plan proposed is the best, if concentration can be made in time, especially before Sherman and Schofield could unite.
Johnston now commands here.  G. T.  Beauregard.    
  Charlotte, N. C., Feb. 27th, 1865. Genl. R. E. Lee, Petersburg, Va.:  
General Johnston assumed command day before yesterday (25th). Enemy's position still about same, on Lancaster and Camden road, made almost impassable by heavy rains.  G. T.  Beauregard.    
  Charlotte, N. C., Feb. 28th, 1865. Genl. B. Bragg, Rocky Point, near Wilmington, N. C.:  
As Fayetteville may be our future point of concentration, will you order all roads and bridges repaired forthwith to it from Warsaw, Smithfield, and Raleigh?  G. T.  Beauregard.    
Appendix to chapter XLVI. 
General Hampton's statement before United States Commissioner Brooks, in relation to the burning of Columbia.  
Being duly sworn, General Hampton said: On the night of the 16th of February he received a telegram from President Davis, announcing his promotion to the position of Lieutenant-General, and directing him to assume command of all the cavalry in South Carolina; General Beauregard was the  Commander-in-chief. General Hampton's command consisted of Wheeler's corps of cavalry, and a division of cavalry under General M. C. Butler, amounting in all to about 4100 men, in and about Columbia, when Sherman advanced on the city with 75,000 men. The only attempt to check the advance of the Federal troops was made at Congaree Creek by General Butler, who had under his command a few of his own and Wheeler's men and a small Kentucky brigade under Breckinridge, the whole number not exceeding six hundred men. This affair occurred on the 15th, after which the advance of Sherman was undisputed.
The Federal army arrived opposite Columbia on the 15th, and without any warning began to shell the town in every direction.
Hunt's Hotel, where General Beauregard had his headquarters, was struck by a piece of shell; two or three shells struck the workshops; one passed through the old State House, and three struck the new State House, the marks of which are still to be seen.
Some of the shells were thrown as far as the Charlotte road, which is two miles from the river, and some passed near the asylum, which is the northeastern boundary of the city.
The shelling took place early on the morning of the 16th, and during that night the Federal troops commenced the passage of the river.
On the morning of the 17th General Hampton directed the officers under his command to withdraw their men from Columbia and its vicinity, as the city was to be surrendered and no offensive acts were to be committed.
The Confederates were ordered to be moved to Winnsboroa.
When General Beauregard was advised of what had been done he left the city and also went off towards Winnsboroa, feeling quite unwell at the time.
General Hampton then instructed the Mayor of Columbia, Dr. T. J. Goodwyn, to send out a flag of truce to meet the advance-guard of Sherman's army, and to announce that the city was evacuated, and that he had come out to surrender it. This was about six o'clock on the morning of the 17th. General Hampton gave the Mayor directions how to proceed, where to go, and what he was to do; he then called his attention to the cotton that was lying along Richardson Street, and recommended that he should put a guard over it, telling him there was danger that it would take fire, and that if it did so it would endanger the city.
This cotton had been removed from the warehouses where it had been stored, in order to transport it to the open fields adjoining the city, where it might be burned; but finding there was not sufficient means for transportation, it was left in Richardson Street. The Mayor, with a flag of truce, met the leading column of the Federal army, composed of Stone's brigade, and surrendered the city.
General Hampton had moved out by the Asylum road, with one of Butler's brigades, and stationed himself at the upper boundary street, facing towards Richardson Street. From the position he occupied he commanded a view of the whole town and vicinity.
He saw the Mayor come back with the flag, and surrounded by columns of troops.
It was about 10 A. M. when the Federal troops entered Columbia, and about 9 A. M. when General Hampton had the conversation with the Mayor in the vicinity of the cotton.
There were no Confederate troops in Columbia when the Federal army entered.
General Hampton was the last officer in the town, and he left just prior to the entry of the Federal army.
He states positively that up to that time there  were no fires in progress in Columbia.
When asked what orders were given in reference to the disposition of the cotton in Columbia, immediately prior to the 17th of February, General Hampton stated that an order had been issued by General Beauregard on the 14th to Major Allen J. Green, the post commander, to have the cotton moved out of the warehouses to a place where it could be burned, if it became necessary to do so, without endangering the town.
Not having the transportation at his disposal, Major Green had placed it in the streets.
On the night of the 16th, when General Hampton was assigned to duty at Columbia, he called General Beauregard's attention to the position of this cotton, telling him that if it were burned it would endanger the town, and urged him to order that the cotton should not be burned.
This he did. Being asked whether that order not to fire the cotton had been carried out by the Confederates, he answered that he knew by official investigation and by personal observation that it had not been fired by them. 
General Hampton's letter to General Beauregard.  
  wild woods, Miss., April 22d, 1866.  
General,—General Sherman having charged me in his official report with the destruction of Columbia, and having repeated the same falsehood in a recent letter to Benjamin Rawlins, of that city, may I beg you to state such facts in reference to this matter as are in your possession?
You were in command of the Confederate troops when Sherman entered Columbia; you had left the city just before he occupied it, and you gave orders not only as to the movements of troops, but as to the disposition of all the public property, as well as of the cotton which was in the city.
You were, therefore, fully cognizant of all the facts relating to the burning of the city, and you can state with entire certainty who is answerable for this atrocious crime. 
I am, very respectfully yours,  Wade  Hampton.   
General Beauregard's endorsement of the foregoing letter.  
  New Orleans, May 2d, 1866.  
The above statement of General Wade Hampton, relative to the orders issued by me at Columbia, S. C., not to burn cotton in that city, is perfectly true and correct.
The only thing on fire at the time of the evacuation was the depot building of the South Carolina Railroad, which caught fire accidentally from the explosion of some ammunition ordered to be sent towards Charlotte, N. C.  G. T.  Beauregard.   
Governor Orr's letter to General Hampton.  
  Washington, Dec. 28th, 1872.  
Dear Sir,—I have received your letter inquiring as to my recollection of a conversation that occurred in the Executive Office in Columbia, in 1867, between yourself and General Howard, of the United States Army, as to the burning  of Columbia.
I do not remember all that was said; but General Howard said, in substance, that the city was burned by the United States troops; that he saw them fire many houses, and that he tried to arrest the conflagration; and that he regretted the destruction of the city.
Without undertaking to give his words, the foregoing contains the substance of what he said relative to the destruction of Columbia. 
Very respectfully,  James L.  Orr.   
General John S. Preston's letter to Dr. Trezevante.  
  Columbia, Jan. 2d, 1873.  
Desr Sir,—I have your note asking me to state my recollection of the conversation between Wade Hampton and Howard, in the presence of Governor Orr, myself, and others.
The substance of the conversation was that General Howard said, and reiterated it, that no one was authorized to say that the Federal troops did not burn Columbia, and he saw them doing so in numerous instances and in various localities in the town.
The conversation was almost exclusively between General Hampton and General Howard, the other persons present saying but very little. 
Very truly yours,  John S.  Preston.   
Extract from the Rev. A. Toomer Porter's testimony before the Committee of citizens, appointed by authority of the South Carolina Legislature. 
* * * In the bright light of the burning city, General Sherman recognized me and remarked: This is a horrible sight!
Yes, I replied, when you reflect that women and children are the victims.
 He said,  Your Governor is responsible for this.
 How so?
I replied.
Who ever heard, he said, of an evacuated city being left a depot of liquor for an army to occupy?
I found one hundred and twenty casks of whiskey in one cellar.
Your Governor, being a lawyer or a judge, refused to have it destroyed, as it was private property, and now my men have got drunk, and have got beyond my control, and this is the result.
Extract from Mayor Goodwyn's testimony before the same Committee. 
* * * The same day (18th of February) General Sherman, deposes the Mayor, sent for me. I went to see him about 1 o'clock. He met me very cordially, and said he regretted very much that our city was burned, and that it was my fault.
I asked him how?
He said, in suffering ardent spirits to be left in the city after it was evacuated, saying, Who could command drunken soldiers?
There was no allusion made to General Hampton, to accident, or to cotton. * * * I saw very few drunken soldiers that night; many who appeared to sympathize with our people told me that the fate and doom of Columbia had been common talk around their camp-fires ever since they left Savannah.
Extract from the report of the Committee of citizens appointed by the South Carolina Legislature to collect evidence in relation to the burning of Columbia.
the document referred to, besides being made the subject of a special report to the South Carolina Legislature, was also published in full in the Charleston news and courier of September 11th, 1879. 
* * * Within an hour afterwards three rockets were seen to ascend from a point in front of the Mayor's dwelling.
But a few minutes elapsed before fires in swift succession broke out, and at points so far apart that they could not have been communicated from the one to the other.
At various parts of the town the soldiers, at the appearance of the rockets, declared that they were the appointed signals for a general conflagration.
The fire companies, with their engines, promptly repaired to the scene of the fires and endeavored to arrest them, but in vain.
The soldiers of General Sherman, with bayonets and axes, pierced and cut the hose, disabled the engines, and prevented the citizens from extinguishing the flames.
Extracts from General Sherman's testimony as filed, with other official Depositions in certain claims vs. United States, before the mixed commission on British and American claims, in Washington, D. C.  
 * * * * * * * 
Question. You, however, entered the city of Columbia with the main army about two hours later? 
Answer. Yes, sir. 
Q. I would like for you to be particular; please try and remember how long it was afterwards? 
A. Stone's brigade could not have been in town more than an hour and a half before I came in; we came in very quickly; the pontoon-bridge was nearly done when I got this message from Stone, and sent back and told him to go right into town. * * * 
Q. Wouldn't this be about correct if you were to say that the main army entered Columbia about 12 o'clock? 
A. Near 11; I suppose nearer 11 than 12 o'clock. Somewhere between 11 and 12. 
Q. You were riding at the head of the column? 
A. Yes, sir. 
Q. With General Howard? 
A. General Howard was by my side; he was commanding the right wing and I was commanding in chief. * * * Our staffs rode right behind us, and their came the head of the column, which, I think, was the second division, 15th Corps, commanded by General Charles R. Woods. 
Q. General Howard, then, I understand you to say, had orders from you as to the disposition of troops? 
A. Yes, sir. * * * The leading division of the 15th Corps, commanded by General Woods, was to occupy Columbia, and the other two divisions to pass through and encamp just outside the town. * * *  
Q. Do I understand you to say that burning cotton flies in the air? 
A. Indeed it does. 
Q. About how many feet high in the air? 
A. As many as six hundred feet; yes, I saw it fly, probably, from four or five hundred yards—fifteen hundred feet in distance. 
Q. I do not mean rolling along the ground. 
A. No, sir; I mean up in the air, like a fire-ball. 
Q. How about height: does it rise above ten feet? 
A. Yes, sir; one hundred and fifty feet; whirling round. 
Q. Balls of what size? 
A. Probably fifty pounds—forty or fifty pounds. 
Q. How many feet in the air? 
A. One hundred, or one hundred and fifty feet in the air. * * * 
Q. But the police force was from Woods's division of the 15th Corps, save such stragglers as may have strayed in from other commands? 
A. Yes, sir; all the troops in Columbia were from the 15th Corps, save such stragglers as may have strayed in from other commands. * * *  Jas. O.  Clephane, United States Commissioner.   
Appendix to chapter XLVII. 
General Beauregard's instructions to General Hardee.  
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, Charlotte, N. C., Feb. 26th, 1865. Lieut.-Genl. W. J. Hardee, Cheraw, S. C.:  
General,—The enemy at last accounts having been at Rocky Mount and Peay's Ferry, on the Catawba River, and it being still undetermined whether he will move thence on this place or upon Fayetteville, N. C., via Cheraw, you will please concentrate your forces as rapidly as possible at the latter place, and there hold them in readiness to move at a moment's notice, either on this point, as already instructed, or to oppose his advance as long as possible should he march by the way of Cheraw, in which event Hampton's cavalry will cooperate with you. 
Should any movement of Schofield from Wilmington threaten to intercept your march upon Fayetteville, and you are not strong enough to give him battle, you will then retire slowly in the direction of Raleigh, doing all in your power to check your adversary's advance at all favorable positions. 
A line of couriers has been established hence to Fayetteville, via Cheraw or Rockingham, as the movements of the enemy shall make necessary. 
Please keep General Bragg (who is still near Wilmington) and myself advised of your movements, and of those of the enemy which may come to your knowledge.
There is telegraphic communication from Fayetteville with these Headquarters. 
Your Engineers should repair forthwith the roads and bridges on the route  to Fayetteville and Salisbury, including, especially, a new bridge across Rocky River.
In conclusion, I will again call your attention to the importance of saving surplus stores and supplies of all descriptions at Cheraw.
To that end they should be held stored in trains, ready, at the proper moment, to be sent by rail, either in the direction of the Santee River or towards Manchester, or even to Camden, as may become most judicious, in view of known movements of the enemy. 
In case of a retrograde movement before the enemy, you will please remove or destroy all supplies of every kind liable to fall into his hands, in which connection I enclose General Orders No. 4, A. and I.
G. Office. 
Respectfully, General, your obedient servant,  G. T.  Beauregard.    
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, Charlotte, N. C., March 1st, 1865. Lieut.-Genl. W. J. Hardee, Cheraw, S. C.:  
General,—Your letter of the 27th ult. has been received.
My letter of the 26th covers all the points submitted by you. The enemy moving to the eastward, your forces will no longer be required here; you will therefore act as already instructed.
It is of the utmost importance that he should not get any of the surplus stores and supplies at Cheraw; they should be destroyed, as well as the rolling-stock of those railroads, sooner than fall in the enemy's hands.
For fear that the enemy may have some engines and cars to run on the Northeastern, the Wilmington and Manchester, and the Wilmington and Charlotte railroads, it is advisable to destroy effectually the bridges on the Santee (if not already done), on the Little Pedee and on the Big Swamp.
The cars and engines should be so disposed of as not to fall in the hands of the enemy.
In case of danger they should be thoroughly destroyed.
The prisoners at Florence should be sent forthwith to Fayetteville or Raleigh if not received by the enemy at Wilmington.
Should the enemy move towards Georgetown, you should endeavor to co-operate with the cavalry to press on his flanks and rear.
Under present circumstances no instructions will be sent to await your arrival at Wadesboroa.
The most energetic measures should be taken by the military and civil authorities to obstruct all roads on which the enemy is likely to move, using, freely, torpedoes to prevent the removal of these obstructions.
Mr. Frazer Mathews knows how to lay these torpedoes to the best advantage.
The bridge on Rocky River should be rebuilt. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  G. T.  Beauregard.    
  Headquarters, Military division of the West, Charlotte, N. C., March 6th, 1865. Lieut.-Genl. W. J. Hardee, Rockingham, via Troy:  
General,—I have just received a copy of your telegram of the 4th inst., from Rockingham to General Johnston, who is on his way to Fayetteville.
You  should have followed the instructions contained in my letter of the 26th ult. (acknowledged by Colonel Roy) and not of the 24th.
Fayetteville and Raleigh being evidently the objective points of the enemy, General Johnston and myself contemplate a concentration of forces at the first of those points, if possible, otherwise at the latter.
You are therefore directed to remove at once, and rapidly, from your present position to Fayetteville, if still practicable; if not, to Raleigh. 
The ends to be attained by this movement are so momentous, indeed so vital to success of operations which have been determined upon, that it is expected you will permit none but insurmountable obstacles to turn you aside from the attempt, except, of course, if General Johnston should see cause, in the existing state of affairs, to change your instructions and give other orders. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  G. T. Beauregard, Genl.    
Telegram.  Charlotte, N. C., March 7th, 1865. Genl. Jos. E. Johnston, Fayetteville, N. C.:  
Have just received copy telegram to you from Hardee, saying he is moving on Greensboroa.
He has not obeyed my instructions of 26th ult. He should be recalled at once to Fayetteville or Raleigh. 
Shall troops from here be sent to Smithfield or Raleigh?  G. T.  Beauregard.    
Telegram.  Charlotte, N. C., March 7th, 1865. Genl. Jos. E. Johnston, Fayetteville, N. C.:  
To save time I have sent following despatch from here and Greensboroa to General Hardee, on road from Rockingham: March at once on Fayetteville, if possible; if not, then on Raleigh.  G. T.  Beauregard.    
Telegram.  Raleigh, N. C., March 11th, 1865. To Genl. G. T. Beauregard:  
Federal army is in Fayetteville this morning.
Hardee and Hampton near on this side.
General Bragg's troops are returning to Goldsboroa from Kinston, where the force opposed to his was heavily reinforced from Wilmington.
That force was beaten by General Bragg with Hill's and Hoke's troops on the 8th.  J. E.  Johnston.    
Telegram.  Raleigh, March 13th, 1865. To Genl. Beauregard:  
Following received, dated March 12th, 8 P. M., from near Fayetteville: Enemy crossed Cape Fear River (at 11 A. M.) at Cedar Creek, Fayetteville, and Elliott's ferry, seven miles above.
I move up to cover all ferries above.
Enemy's purpose not developed.—W. J. Hardee.
If these crossings are in force, a movement eastward is intended.
Hope to see you soon.  J. E.  Johnston.     
Telegram.  Greensboroa, N. C., March 14th, 1865. Genl. Jos. E. Johnston, Raleigh:  
Sherman is moving, doubtless to form junction with Schofield's forces about Goldsboroa.
As you cannot yet check him, it would be well to concentrate all your forces against Schofield and crush him before that junction can be made.  G. T.  Beauregard.    
Telegram.  Headquarters, Raleigh, N. C., March 15th, 1865:7 A. M.  
Received from Smith's Ferry, 2 P. M., 14th, via Bonbee's 15th, 4 A. M., by General Johnston: 
The enemy advanced on the river and plank roads to-day to Silver Creek, where I had a brigade of infantry.
Hampton fell back.
At his request the infantry was withdrawn, and the line occupied by dismounted cavalry.
The enemy came up, felt the lines sharply, and retired about four miles. I was on the cavalry front myself to-day, and don't think the advance in this direction was serious or in large force.
Distant cannonading heard this evening; supposed to be on the Clinton road, in Butler's front.
I expect to hear from him during the night.  W. J.  Hardee. Official. W.  Hampton, Jr., Lieut., and A. D. C.    
Telegram.  Averysboroa, March 15th, 1865, via Bonbee's, March 15TH: 12.30 P. M. Genl. J. E. Johnston, Raleigh, N. C.:  
The enemy, after being checked at Silver Run, retired towards Fayetteville.
Hampton has transferred his command over Black River to be in front of any movement upon Goldsboroa.
I heard nothing from Butler on the Clinton road during the night, and I am holding my command here awaiting further information.
Prisoners say Sherman is receiving supplies at Fayetteville, by water, from Wilmington.  W. J.  Harder.    
Telegram.  Smithfield, March 16th, 1865. Genl. G. T. Beauregard:

By order of General Johnston.  Archer  Anderson, A. A. G.    
Telegram.  Smithfield, March 17th, 1865. Genl. G. T. Beauregard:  
The enemy were attacking General Hardee's position, five miles south of  Averysboroa, all day yesterday.
Always repulsed.
Our loss between four and five hundred.
Prisoners taken this morning report Federals at thirty-three hundred.
Please hurry S. D. Lee, and desire commanding officer at Salisbury to send our transportation and artillery horses along the railroad, to be taken up wherever they may meet trains.  J. E.  Johnston.     
Telegram.  Smithfield, March 20th, 1865. To Genl. Beauregard:  
The 15th and 17th corps were yesterday moving on the road from Fayetteville to Goldsboroa; the 14th and 20th on that from Averysboroa.
We attacked the latter force at 3 P. M., routed one corps, capturing three guns; but a mile in rear the enemy rallied on fresh troops.
We were able to press all back slowly until six, when, apparently receiving fresh troops, he attempted the offensive, which we resisted without difficulty until dark.
Our troops behaved handsomely.
This morning enemy was intrenched.
We have now the whole army in our front.
The 15th Corps, moving from direction of Goldsboroa on our left flank and rear, made it necessary to change our front so as to look to the south.
There has so far been only skirmishing to-day.
Please give this information to the Governor in my name.  J. E.  Johnston.    
Telegram.  near Bentonville, March 21st, 1865:7.10 A. M. Genl. G. T. Beauregard:  
We are remaining here to cover the removal of our wounded to railroad at Smithfield.
The enemy's intrenched position and greatly superior number-Sherman's army being in our front—makes further offensive impracticable.  J. E.  Johnston.    
Telegram.  near Smithfield, March 23d, 1865. To Genl. G. T. Beauregard:  
Sherman's whole army being intrenched in our front on morning of 20th, we did not attack, but held our position to cover removal of wounded and occupy enemy.
There was heavy skirmishing 20th and 21st, and several partial attacks by him handsomely repulsed.
Troops of Tennessee Army have fully disproved slander that has been published against them.
Evening and night of 21st enemy moved towards Goldsboroa, and yesterday we came here.  J. E.  Johnston.    
Telegram.  Smithfield, March 24th, 1865. Genl. G. T. Beauregard:  
Sherman and Schofield have united at Goldsboroa.
Seven corps. I am placing our troops north of the depot and near it. Our cavalry is moving forward.
Do urge Lee forward.
His troops ought to march in several bodies, those leading never to wait for those following.
General Lee seems to be committing the error of making the front wait for the rear.
On reaching railroad, marching should be continued by those not taken up at Chester until they meet trains.  J. E.  Johnston.    
Telegram.  Raleigh, N. C., March 24th, 1865:1.35 P. M. Genl. S. D. Lee, at Chester, S. C. (or to be forwarded):  
General Johnston desires you to urge forward your troops as rapidly as possible.
 On reaching the Charlotte Railroad, marching should continue by troops not taken up until they meet train coming for them.  G. T.  Beauregard.    
Telegram.  Raleigh, N. C., March 26th, 1865: 12 M. Lieut.-Genl. S. D. Lee, care of Capt. Buck, A. A. G., at Fort Mills, Rock Hill, or Chester, S. C.:

General Johnston to General Beauregard.  
  Baltimore, Md., March 30th, 1868.  
My dear General,—I have been told by a gentleman who has read the life of Mr. Davis, recently published, that it contains the identical statements of the interviews and discussions at Greensboroa, in which we had a part, mentioned to you in my note of December 26th, 1867.
That our statement may be on record, too I write you my recollections of these circumstances, suggesting that, where yours are different, you write the difference, and that, if yours agree with mine, you express your concurrence. 
On the afternoon of April 11th, 1865, I received at Raleigh a telegraphic order from the President to report to him at Greensboroa.
I arrived about nine o'clock next morning (12th), and was your guest, your quarters being in a burden car, near and in sight of the President's. 
In discussing the probable object for which I had been called to Greensboroa, we agreed in the supposition that it was connected with the decision of the question of terminating or continuing the war. We agreed, also, that it would  not be worth while to go into any military discussion before information was received of the condition of General Lee's army. 
We were summoned to the President's office in an hour or two, finding Messrs. Benjamin, Mallory, and Reagan with him. We supposed that we were to be questioned upon the military resources of our Department.
The President's object seemed to be, however, to give—not to obtain—information; for, addressing the party, he explained to us how, in a few weeks (he said two or three), he would raise a large army by bringing back into the ranks those who had abandoned their regiments, and by calling out the enrolled men that the officers of the Conscript Bureau had been unable to bring into the military service.
It was remarked by me, and supported by you, that men who had left the army when our cause was not desperate, and those who, under the same circumstances, could not be forced into it by the agents of the Conscript Bureau, would scarcely, in our present condition, enter the service upon mere invitation.
No other subject was introduced. 
General Breckinridge arrived that evening (12th), and confirmed the reports of General Lee's surrender, which had been spread through the country by fugitives from his army.
We then reviewed the state of affairs, and agreed in the opinion that the Confederacy was overthrown; that, practically, we had no longer a Government, because Mr. Davis and his Cabinet had lost all the attributes of one: having no control over the people, no money, nor credit, nor basis of credit, nor army, nor ammunition, nor means for obtaining them.
They could not, therefore, support the little army then existing.
Under these circumstances we regarded it as criminal to continue the war, and thought that the only function of Government left the President should be exercised at once —that of making peace. 
In consultation with General Breckinridge next morning (13th) I expressed to him these views of ours, and, believing that none of his Cabinet would do it, offered to suggest to the President to act upon them.
General Breckinridge promised to endeavor to make the opportunity for me. I also conversed with Mr. Mallory on the same subject afterwards, and he appeared to be anxious that negotiations should be proposed. 
We were summoned to the President's office the same morning (13th), an hour or two after the meeting of his Cabinet.
There I, as oldest, speaking first—you sustaining me—we compared the military forces: ours about 17,000, infantry and artillery, and 4000 cavalry; that of the enemy about 180,000 men, under Grant, about 110,000 under Sherman, and about 60,000 under Canby.
We, without the means of purchasing supplies of any kind, or procuring or repairing arms, could continue the war only as robbers or guerillas.
Under such circumstances it was represented that it would be the greatest of human crimes on our part to continue the war, and therefore the opening of negotiations was suggested.
The members of the Cabinet present were then invited to express their opinions.
All, except Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Davis, agreed with us. He (Mr. B.) repeated something very like Sempronius's speech for war. Mr. Davis received these suggestions of mine as if annoyed by them.
He said that it was idle to propose that he should attempt to negotiate, when it was certain, from  the result of an attempt of his to treat, that his authority to treat would not be recognized by Mr. Lincoln, nor terms that he might offer considered.
I suggested that it had not been unusual for military commanders to arrange preliminaries, which led to treaties of peace, and asked permission to make such an attempt.
After speaking for a short time in opposition to that idea, he suggested, or rather consented, that I should propose an armistice to General Sherman, to permit the civil authorities to enter into the needful arrangements to terminate the existing war, and sketched the letter to be addressed to the Federal commander.
I immediately proposed that Mr. Mallory—a good penman— should write such a letter at his dictation, and that I should sign and send it. And this was done, and the conference then terminated. 
Yours truly,  J. E.  Johnston.   
General Beauregard's endorsement.  
  New Orleans, April 10th, 1868.  
I fully concur in the above recollections of General Johnston, relative to the events which transpired at Greensboroa, N. C., at the time of the surrender of his forces.
He took the initiative in suggesting the negotiations with General Sherman, and conducted them, with the assistance of General Breckinridge, to a successful issue, as far as that Federal officer was concerned. 
I suggested to General Johnston the propriety of having a member of the Cabinet (General Breckinridge) with him to protect him from the invidious and ungenerous remarks which would certainly be made, otherwise, by the surroundings of the President, relative to any terms he might agree upon with General Sherman. 
General Johnston telegraphed to that effect to President Davis, who was then on his way to Charlotte, N. C., and General Breckinridge returned to Greensboroa, to take a part in the impending negotiations with General Sherman.  G. T.  Beauregard.    
  Headquarters, Army of Tennessee, April 16th, 1865:4 P. M.  
General,—I have the honor to inform you that General Johnston's headquarters are established about one mile and a quarter west of Greensboroa.

  April 15th, 1865. Mr. Hendren, C. S. Treasurer:  
Sir,—You will report to General Beauregard with the treasure in your possession, that he may give to it due protection as a military chest, to be moved with his army train.
For further instructions you will report to the Secretary of the Treasury.  Jefferson  Davis.    
I have, in accordance with said order, respectfully to request that you will at once designate the officer to whom the silver coin (estimated to be $39,000) may be transferred, the transfer to be accompanied by a schedule of explanation.

  Treasury, C. S. A., Greensboroa, N. C., April 16th, 1865. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, Genl. Comdg., etc.:  
Sir,—I have the honor to again invite your attention to the wishes of the President in connection with the coin of the Confederate States remaining in my hands, as indicated in his order addressed to you, which I had the honor to communicate to you on yesterday. 
In your reply to my letter I was informed that the matter would be submitted to General Johnston upon his arrival here (and he is understood to have arrived this morning), when he would designate the proper officer to receive the money.
It is now half-past 3 o'clock, and I have not yet been advised of such designation.
In view of the public situation, and the risk to which I am subjected, it does not seem to me, isolated as I am from the Government, that I should be expected, nor am I disposed to attempt longer the vain and dangerous task of its guardianship, and therefore respectfully insist that the arrangement  ordered by the President may be consummated without further delay. 
I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,  John N.  Hendren, Treasurer C. S.    
General Beauregard's endorsement on this communication read as follows:

  near Salem, N. C., April 17th, 1865.  
Dear General,—The order directing my command to halt was received last night.
We are all agog respecting the object, and surmises are made that negotiations are afoot between Johnston and Sherman.
If such be not the case, it would be well for me to know it as soon as practicable, that I may contradict it. The report, as you may well conceive, can do our troops no good. 
Very truly yours,  W. J.  Hardee. Genl. Beauregard, Comdg., etc., etc.    
  Greensboroa, N. C., April 17th, 1865:11.30 A. M.  
General,—Your note of this day from near Salem has just reached me. I regret I am not at liberty to inform you as to your inquiry.
General Johnston will probably do so himself in the course of the day, or as soon as he shall have returned from Hillsboroa.
Meanwhile, keep your troops well in hand for rapid movement at a moment's notice, should it become necessary. 
Respectfully, your obedient servant,  G. T.  Beauregard, Genl. 2d Comdg. Lieut.-Genl. W. J. Hardee, Comdg. Corps near Salem, N. C. Official. R. C.  Gilchrist, A. A. A. G.

  Headquarters, Military division of the Mississippi. In the field, Raleigh, N. C., April 27th, 1865. Genl. Johnston, Comdg. Confederate Armies, etc., Greensboroa:  
General,—I herewith enclose you copies of my Field Orders, No. 65, which give General Schofield full and ample power to carry into effect our convention, and I hope at your personal interview with General Schofield you satisfied your mind of his ability and kind disposition towards the inhabitants of North Carolina. 
In addition to the points made at our interview of yesterday, I have further instructed General Schofield to facilitate what you and I and all good men desire, the return to their homes of the officers and men composing your army,  to let you have of his stores ten days rations for twenty-five thousand men. We have abundance of provisions at Morehead City, and if you send trains here, they may go down with our trains and return to Greensboroa with the rations specified.
Colonel Wright did intend to send his construction train up to-day, but did not get up his carpenters in time.
The train with square timber and carpenters will go up in the morning, and I think by the morning of the 29th your trains can run down on the road and fall in with ours of the 30th. 
I can hardly estimate how many animals fit for farm purposes will be loaned to the farmers, but enough, I hope, to insure a crop. 
I can hardly commit myself how far commerce will be free, but I think the cotton still in the country, and the crude turpentine, will make money with which to procure supplies.
General Schofield, in a few days, will be able to arrange all such matters. 
I wish you would send the enclosed parcel for General Wilson, as it contains the Orders, 65 and 66, and instructions to release all his prisoners on the conditions of our convention. 
Now that war is over, I am as willing to risk my person and reputation as heretofore to heal the wounds made by the past war, and I think my feeling is shared by the whole army.
I also think a similar feeling actuates the mass of your army; but there are some unthinking young men, who have no sense or experience, that unless controlled may embroil their neighbors.
If we are forced to deal with them it must be with severity; but I hope they will be managed by the people of the South. 
I am, with respect, your obedient servant,  W. T.  Sherman, Major-Genl. U. S. A. Official. Kinloch  Falconer, A. A. G.    
Telegram of General J. E. Johnston to the Governors of North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, dated April 27th, 1865: 
The disaster in Virginia, the capture by the enemy of all our workshops for the preparation of ammunition and repairing of arms, the impossibility of recruiting our little army, opposed to more than ten times its number, or of supplying it, except by robbing our own citizens, destroyed all hope of successful war. I have made, therefore, a military convention with Major-General Sherman, to terminate hostilities in North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.
I made this convention to spare the blood of this gallant little army, to prevent further suffering of our people by the devastation and ruin inevitable from the marches of invading armies, and to avoid the crime of waging a hopeless war.
General Breckinridge to President Davis.  
  half mile West of Savannah Bridge, May 3d, 1865:8 P. M.  
Dear Sir,—I have not heard from you in answer to my note of this day, and the condition of things here, together with great fatigue, has prevented my going forward.
Nothing can be done with the bulk of this command.
It has been with difficulty that anything has been kept in shape.
I am having the silver paid to the troops, and will in any event save the gold and have it brought forward in the morning, when I hope Judge Reagan will take it. 
Many of the men have thrown away their arms.
Most of them have resolved to remain here under Vaugh and Dibbrell and will make terms.
A few hundred men will move on and may be depended on for the object we spoke of yesterday.
I would respectfully and earnestly repeat the suggestions I then made.
Let me know if you desire me to adopt any other course than that proposed.
If you are at Washington, or this side, I can ride forward in the morning to see you. 
Yours, very truly,  John C.  Breckinridge, Secty. of War.

Appendix to chapter L.  
  Atlanta, Ga., Dec. 21st, 1882. Genl. G. T. Beauregard, New Orleans, La.:  
My dear Sir,—Your very kind and highly appreciated letter of the 9th ult., enclosing a slip from the New Orleans Times-Democrat, containing an article signed D, commenting upon my speech in Macon, Ga., last fall, in which I referred to the policy of the Confederate Government, in relation to the proper use of cotton, was received several weeks ago. 
You will please excuse the delay of my response to it. Pressure of public duties has been the cause. 
I thank you for the slip containing the article signed D, to which I have referred.
This article, in answer to what I was reported to have said at Macon, reproduces two letters: one from Mr. Memminger and one from Mr. Trenholm, former secretaries of the Confederate Treasury, written in 1874, in reply to General Johnston's statement upon the same subject. 
You asked if I have replied to this article; in answer I can only say that I have not, and do not think I ever shall.
My views upon the question have been too long before the country to need any explanation from me, now or hereafter, so far as I see. Whether Mr. Davis is the author of this article signed D, or not (as you suggest he probably is), I do not know; and while I do not intend myself to make any communication to the public upon the subject, yet it might be very well indeed for you, or some one else who has time and ability who agrees with me on the general policy, to make suitable comments upon it, and especially upon Messrs. Memminger and Trenholm's letters, in reply to General Joseph E. Johnston.
These letters, as they stand, are calculated to mislead, if not deceive.
For Messrs. Memminger and Trenholm, I need hardly say, I ever entertained the highest personal respect; but their letters, it seems to me, were not written with that mature consideration of the facts which was due to the magnitude of the subject.
They are utterly inconsistent with each other, and are alike deceptive in argument.
Mr. Memminger, for instance, makes no issue  upon the point that there were four millions of bales of cotton in the country at the time of the formation of the Confederacy; this point he seems to admit, while Mr. Trenholm attempts to show that the entire crop of 1860, amounting to less than four millions of bales, had at that time been shipped from the South, either to the North or to Europe, and that there was no surplus on hand.
If Mr. Trenholm was right in his figures and facts, then why need Mr. Memminger, who was at the time at the head of the Treasury Department, have said what he did in defence of the Administration against the charge of negligence or a blunder in policy?
Why need he have argued that there was no way in which the Government could have got possession of this cotton except by seizure, purchase, and donation, and the utter impracticability of the Government getting possession of the cotton in any practicable or feasible way?
This argument implies the presence of the cotton within the limits of the Confederacy at the time.
Then, with Mr. Trenholm's figures and facts, what becomes of Mr. Memminger's argument that it would have required four thousand ships to have removed the cotton, which was impossible, while Mr. Trenholm claims that it had already been done?
He claims that 3,800,000 bales had actually been shipped, and was already beyond the reach of the Confederacy before its formation.
How these gentlemen, with all their great eminence and ability, can reconcile these views, I leave for them and others to settle. 
Then again, how fallacious and delusive is Mr. Memminger's argument attempting to show the difficulties attending the payment for the cotton in Treasury notes, and in this way flooding the country with a depreciated currency.
The truth is, the plan advocated by me and my associates on this line of policy, from the beginning, was not to issue Treasury notes, to be given in payment of the cotton, but it was for the Government to offer as much as ten cents a pound for all the cotton then in the country, to be paid for in bonds running for years at eight per cent. per annum.
It was believed by us that at least two million bales of cotton would have been sold by the planters at these rates, taking the bonds as an investment running for twenty or thirty years, as might have been thought best.
These bonds would not have been thrown upon the market as currency, for there was far too much currency in the form of Treasury notes already in the country: the planters would have held these bonds as an investment.
This at least was my view of it. Some might have sold their bonds, just as many people afterwards sold their Confederate bonds, given under what was known as the Confederate Produce Loan; and just as many persons to-day sell at a premium United States bonds; but these do not in this way become a part of the currency or tend to depreciate it. 
What Mr. Memminger says about the short time from the formation of the Confederacy in February and May, when the blockade was declared, is equally without point or force; it is well known that the blockade so-called, during the summer and fall of 1861, and the winter of 1862, was nothing but a paper blockade, it, did not amount at all to an effectual closing of our ports; it was not until after the early part of 1862 that the blockade was made effectual along the southern coast, from Savannah to New Orleans.
In the mean time it appeared to me that, of the crop on hand, whether two or three millions of bales of 1860,  and the two or three millions of bales of 1861, at least four million bales, with proper forecast and military energy, might have been gotten abroad before the ports were effectually closed as aforesaid.
I maintained and showed conclusively, as I thought, that two million bales in hands of the Government could have been so used as to prevent the blockade from ever being made effectual.
This I maintained in numerous speeches in 1861 and 1862. 
The report of my Macon speech, an extract of which is given by the New Orleans Times' correspondent, D, in the main was correct, but in details was very erroneous.
This must have been apparent to every intelligent reader.
The word reverently, in the extract quoted from the report, was not used at all by me in that connection.
The word used was earnestly; but I cannot now undertake to point out the various verbal errors in the report; but if the writer, D, in the Times be (as you say is supposed) Mr. Davis, he ought, it seems to me, to have denied the correctness of the statement of Dr. Craven cited by me in that speech.
Dr. Craven, you may recollect, in his prison life of Mr. Davis, stated, in substance, that Mr. Davis, in conversations, admitted to him that if cotton had been used, as had been urged by some, the result of the struggle might have been different; and he said to Dr. Craven in substance that he himself knew nothing of finances, that he left all such matters to Mr. Memminger, the Secretary of the Treasury, and who was opposed to the policy.
I have not the book before me, and only give the substance of what Mr. Davis said, as reported by Dr. Craven, to the best of my recollection. 
The policy in regard to the proper use of cotton, as advocated by me from the beginning, is to be found in numerous speeches made, from the time the Confederate Congress sat at Montgomery up almost to the collapse which closed the war. 
I send you an extract of one of these speeches, made in the town of Crawfordville (the place of my residence) in the fall of 1862; it was immediately published in the newspapers, and has been in a book containing almost all my public speeches, published in 1866. 
The facts, so far as concerns my position during the whole time on this subject, I have never heard questioned.
This is what I then said: 
* * * The ability of a people to support and wane war depends partly upon their resources, and partly upon the skill and economy with which they are wielded.
We have resources—elements of power to wage war successfully—unknown to Frederick or the men of ‘76.
All necessaries of life, food and clothing, with the munitions of war, can, with skill and forecast, be made and supplied within ourselves.
This goodly laud of ours is unequalled, or at least unsurpassed by any other part of the habitable globe, in the character and variety of its natural products, suited to man's needs and wants in every emergency.
Its mineral resources are also inexhaustible.
It is a land well worth fighting for. Our means are sufficient; they have only to be properly and skilfully developed and applied. 
But besides the products necessary to sustain ourselves, to support our armies, and carry on war, we have another element of tremendous power, if properly used and applied—a resource and power unknown in European  wars, and unknown to our ancestors in the war of their revolution.
Mr. Stephens here said he alluded to our great staple—cotton; and he should not have said more upon it at this time, than barely to ask those present to call to their minds what he had said to most of them last year upon that subject when he addressed them upon the cotton loan, but for some misconceptions that had got in the public mind, from a phonographic report of some remarks he made at a meeting lately in Sparta.
Some, from that report, said Mr. Stephens, have taken the idea that I urged upon the planters there to plant largely of cotton next year.
Allow me, in this connection, to say that nothing could be further from the fact.
I urged upon the planters there, first and above all, to grow grain and stock for home consumption, and to supply the army.
What I said at Sparta upon the subject of cotton many of you have often heard me say in private conversation, and most of you in the public speech last year to which I alluded.
Cotton, I have maintained and do maintain, is one of the greatest elements of power, if not the greatest at our command, if it were but properly and efficiently used, as it might have been, and still might be. Samson's strength was in his locks.
Our strength is in our locks — not of hair or wool, but in our locks of cotton.
I believed from the beginning that the enemy would inflict upon us more serious injury by the blockade than by all other means combined.
It was in the judgment of all a matter of the utmost, if not vital importance, to have it raised, removed, or broken up. How was it to be done?
That was and is the question.
It was thought by many that such was the demand for cotton in England that she would disregard the blockade, as it was, and has been all along, not within the terms of the Paris agreement, that is, has not been at any time entirely effectual, though close enough to do us great injury.
I did not concur in this opinion, as most of you well know.
I thought it would have to be done by ourselves, and could be done through the agency of cotton, not as a political, but as a commercial and financial power.
I was in favor, as you know, of the Government's taking all the cotton that would be subscribed for eight per cent. bonds at a rate or price as high as ten cents a pound. 
Two millions of the last year's crop might have been counted upon as certain on this plan.
This at ten cents, with bags of the average commercial weight, would have cost the government one hundred millions of bonds.
With this amount of cotton in hand and pledged, any number short of fifty of the best ironclad steamers could have been contracted for and built in Europe.
Steamers at the cost of two millions each could be procured every way equal to the Monitor. Thirty millions would have got fifteen of these, which might have been enough for our purpose.
Five might have been ready by the first of January last to open some one of the ports blockaded on our coast.
Three of these could have been left to keep the port open, and two could have convoyed the cotton across the water, if necessary.
Thus the debt could have been promptly paid with cotton at a much higher price than it cost, and a channel of trade kept open till others, and as many more as necessary, might have been built and paid for in the same way. At a cost of less than one mouth's present expenditure on our army, our coast might have been cleared.
Besides  this, at least two more millions of bales of the old crop on hand might have been counted on; this with the other making a debt in round numbers to the planters of $200,000,000. But this cotton held in Europe until its price shall be fifty cents a pound, would constitute a fund of at least $1,000,000,000, which would not only have kept our finances in sound condition, but the clear profit of $800,000,000 would have met the entire expenses of the war for years to come. 
In this way cotton, as a great element of power at our command—such an element as no other people ever had—might have been used, not only in breaking up the blockade by our own means, without looking to foreign intervention, but in supplying the treasury with specie to pay interest on their bonds, thus giving a credit that no government ever had before.
The public credit is as essential as subsistence in war: such at least was and is my opinion.
The Government, however, took a different view of the subject.
Many thought it unconstitutional; some looked upon it as a project to relieve the planters; others thought it nothing short of a South-Sea speculation.
I considered it then and now just as constitutional as to give bonds for gunpowder, or to buy other munitions of war. It was not with a view to relieve the planters, though its incidental accommodation to them would not have been objectionable, but with the view of wielding effectually the element of the greatest power we could command, that I wished the course adopted.
This resource, then, this element of power, we still have, though not to the same extent.
There is enough, however, to effect wonderful results, if properly used, as it can be. We may have lost a year or two, but we are far short of seven years war yet. With our ports open, many of the present evils and hardships of the war would be relieved.
We would no longer have to give fifty dollars for a bushel of Liverpool salt, or ten dollars for the roughest sort of shoes.
With ports open and this in hand, we should be much better able to make it a Peloponnesian struggle, if our enemy choose so to make it. This view and one other idea I presented to the people at Sparta, upon the subject of cotton, which I will repeat here. 
Many to be met with suppose that by abandoning the growth of cotton, and burning what we have, we can force our recognition abroad.
This, I told the people there, and tell you, is, in my judgment, a radical and fundamental error.
England will never be controlled by such a policy.
Our cotton should be treasured up, not destroyed.
More precious is it than gold, for it is more powerful, as a sinew of war, than gold is. 
Like gold, and everything else of value, it should be destroyed, if need be, to prevent its falling into the hands of the enemy, but with no view to a foreign policy; nor should the production of cotton be abandoned with such a view.
You could not please Lord Palmerston better than to let him know that there would not be grown a pound of cotton in the Southern Confederacy for twenty years. The power of cotton is well known to and felt by British statesmen.
They know it is king in its proper sphere, and hence they want the sceptre of this king for their own use. 
The great error of those who suppose that King Cotton would compel the English ministry to recognize our Government and raise the blockade, and who  will look for the same result from the total abandonment of its culture, consists in mistaking the nature of the kingdom of this potentate.
His power is commercial and financial, not political.
It has been one of the leading objects of Lord Palmerston, ever since he has been in office, to stimulate the production of cotton in his own dominions—or those of his sovereign—so as not to be dependent upon us for a supply.
This he cannot do to any extent while his inexperienced producers have to compete with us. Cotton can be raised in their East India possessions and those of the western coast of Africa at eighteen or twenty cents a pound; but it cannot be raised there profitably, to any extent, in competition with us at eight or ten cents. 
If assured, however, of no competition from this quarter, they could, or it is believed would, after a while get to producing it as cheaply as we can. 
Improvements in agriculture are slower in their progress than in any other department of life.
No one can safely or wisely say how cheaply cotton may or may not be grown in those countries with a few years' absolute control of the market, nor that the quality of the article may not be as good.
No one can tell what may be effected by improvements in agriculture, and the introduction of new varieties suitable to climate and soil.
More money can be made here by growing cotton now at eight cents a pound than could be made at eighteen cents forty years ago. The quality is also greatly superior to the old black seed.
More persons can now pick three hundred pounds a day than could pick one hundred when I first recollect; and one hand and horse, or mule, can cultivate twice as much land.
It is a great mistake, I think, to suppose cotton cannot be grown as cheaply, and with as good a staple, fine a fibre, in other countries as it can in this—not in all places where it is now grown, but in some. 
We should not, therefore, think of abandoning the production of cotton with any idea of thereby advancing our interests, politically, abroad.
This would be but playing into the hands of those powers who are trying to break it down.
We have had to curtail it, and shall have to curtail it while the war lasts, especially while the blockade continues.
Duty and patriotism, as well as necessity, require this.
The first great object of all now should be to sustain our cause, to feed as well as clothe men in the field.
To do this, besides raising sufficient provisions for home consumption, will necessarily require larger grain crops.
To have an abundance for home consumption, and for the army, should be the object of every one.
This is dictated by the highest considerations of home policy, and not from any view of advancing our interests abroad.
On the contrary, after sufficient provisions are made for home consumption, and to supply the army, the more cotton that can be grown the better.
How to regulate this is a difficult matter.
When the duty rests upon all alike, to grow grain and raise stock for food, some may be disposed to neglect it. How to meet this difficulty is itself a difficult question.
It might perhaps be done by each State passing a similar law upon the subject, limiting the production of each hand engaged in its culture.
This would require concert of action.
What the limitation should be I am not prepared to say. I have not the necessary estimates and statistics. 
On the subject of foreign recognition, Mr. Stephens said he saw no change  in the prospect.
Foreign governments, he thought, were very much disposed to stand aloof from this contest.
He did not believe they really sympathized with either side—he meant the ruling classes.
The masses of the people and the commercial interests generally, he thought, did sympathize with us. Not so with the rulers.
They care but little for the success of either the North or the South; some of our people were disposed to think that their sympathies were with the North, while the northern people were charging them with sympathy for us. He thought they had no kind feelings for either, but rather rejoiced to see professed republicans cutting each other's throats.
He thought the remark reported to have lately been uttered by Carlyle in his quaint style, embodied in a nutshell the diplomatic feelings of Europe towards the cause on both sides.
The remark was that it was the foulest chimney that had been on fire for a century, and the best way is to let it burn itself out.* * * 
From the foregoing extract it will be seen that I counted upon two millions of bales of the crop of 1860, and two million bales of the crop of 1861, to be gotten out before the ports could be effectually closed by blockade.
It was upon this basis the four millions of bales (not four million and a half bales), stated by me in my Macon speech, was estimated, and from this extract, without further remark or comment, the whole outline of the policy advocated by me on this subject from the beginning clearly appears. 
I will only add that I continued to advocate this policy in the Confederate Congress.
I also presented it with all the earnestness I could to Mr. Davis, the President, on several occasions; but he uniformly replied that it was a matter that belonged to the Treasury Department, and referred me to Mr. Memminger. 
It is proper, also, here to say that notwithstanding Mr. Davis did not entertain my proposition, and notwithstanding our differences upon other matters of policy, yet there never was any bleach between us, and our relations were always friendly.
But upon my urging the policy to Mr. Memminger, he persistently, on all occasions, opposed it most decidedly.
He was not only opposed to the policy upon the impracticability of working it, but also held it to be unconstitutional upon some ground.
I thought it altogether feasible and practicable in its operation, and considered it quite as constitutional as to give bonds for gunpowder or other munitions of war. 
This letter you can use as you please. 
Very truly,  Alexander H.  Stephens.
