THE FLAGS OF LOUISIANA 



By Milledge L. Bonham, Jr. 



While it is common knowledge that several of our States, such 
as New York, Florida and Texas have had several flags, in their 
history, it is not so well known that Louisiana has had more different 
flags — ^nine — than any other commonwealth in the Union. Of 
these nine, eight were (or claimed to be) the insignia of sovereign 
States. Should we count all the various modifications of the various 
flags, for instance, that of Spain, the niunber would be legion rather 
than nine. It is the purpose of this article, however, merely to call 
attention to the nine flags which may be called fundamental, and to 
suggest their significance in the making of the Louisiana of today, 
as a part of the American republic. 

Apparently the first flag to flutter in Louisiana was that of 
Spain, which merely waved in passing, when in 1541, De Soto reached 
the Mississippi in what is now eastern ix)uisiana. What this flag 
was and what it represents will be discussed presently. 

LaSalle seems to have been the godfather to christen the Mis- 
sissippi valley ''Louisiane'' in 1679. He was perhaps the first to dis' 
play the lilies of France in the present State, during his exploration 
of 1682. As in the case of De Soto's flag, LaSalle's sfanply waved in 
passing. 

Pierre LeMoyne, Sieur d' Iberville and his brother, Jean, Sieur 
de Bienville, estalDlished the French colony of Louisiana when they 
settled Biloxi in 1699. On St. Patrick's day of the same year they 
discovered and named Baton Rouge. In 1717, at Natchitoches 
("Nacky-tosh"), Bienville made the first permanent settlement of 
which we are sure, in the present Louisiana. Soon Baton Rouge, 
New Orleans, St. Martinville and other communities began to 
appear. Until the cession of the French possession to England and 
Spain, then, the bourbon banner of France floated over Louisiana, 
and may be taken as the first of our series of nine. It was a white 
silken banner, in the center of which were three golden fleur-de-lys. 
This was the "oriflamme of Navarre" borne by Henri IV at Ivry, 
and becoming the national flag when he ascended the French throne.

What is its significance in Louisiana's history? Its white may 
be taken to stand for the purity of the Ursuline nuns, the first (1727) 
educators in Louisiana, and its gold is indicative of the treasures 
of field, forest and stream, Lilies of every variety — ^human as well 
as horticultural — reproduce the fleur-de-lys. Today the white sym- 
bolizes Louisiana's patriotism and the gold her generous hospitality. 

After the treaty of Paris, in 1763, at the end of the French aiKi 
Indian war, the Bourbon flag withdrew from Louisiana. First it 
disappeared from Baton Rouge and vicinity — known today as "the 
Florida parishes." The little settlement there became "Fort Rich- 
mond" in the British province of West FlcMida, and England's 
scarlet superseded France's white. The British standard, of course, 
consists of a red banner having in the upper, inner comer the "Unkm 
Jack," which is a field of blue on which are now combined the crosses 
of St. George, St. Andrew and St. Partick— though in 1763 only the 
first two appeared. The red and white crosses on the blue field 
produce the same combination fotmd in our own and so many other 
national emblems. From Britain Louisiana has drawn much of her 
constitutional law, just as from Rome, by way of France and Spain, 
she drew her civil law. The crosses of the Union Jack may be taken 
to symbolize the religious liberty enjoyed in Louisiana today. 

Though New Orleans and Louisiana west of the Mississippi 
had been ceded to Spain in 1763, she did not take possession of her 
new colony imtil 1766, when the Bourbon lilies gave place to the lions 
and castles of Spain. Just what was the Spanish flag, as carried by 
De Soto and as brought by Don Antonio de Ulloa in 1766? When 
Coltmibus set sail in 1492 he bore the "standard of Spain," which was 
a quartering of red and grey with a red lion of Leon ramping on the 
grey squares and the yellow castle of Castile on the red. It is doubt- 
ful if this flag was ever displayed in Louisiana, but all its colors are 
there, in the grey of the Spanish moss, the red of the pomegranate— 
not to mention tihe delicious *'redfish courtbouillon" of the Louisiana 
cooks — and the yellow jasmine. De Soto may have borne the "royal 
standard" which was a purple flag bearing the royal coat-of-arms 
in the center. Its color suggests the regal beauty of the women of 
Louisiana, as well as the color of the water-hyacinths and the sugar- 
cane. More familiar is the Spanish merchant flag, of yellow with 
two red stripes, near the upper and lower borders. As an admiral 
of Spain, it is more likely that De Soto carried the naval ensign, 
composed of two bands of red separated by a broader stripe of yel- 
low, in which appears the royal coat-of-arms. It was one of these 
red and yellow banners which became the flag of Louisiana in 1766.

In the life of the State, the red denotes cotirage, a virtue which had 
been displayed by Louisiarlians from the pioneer days of Bienville 
at Natchitoches to the days of General John A. Lejeune and the 
marines at Chateau-Thierry. Red also are the hibiscus flowers of 
Louisiana and red the inviting lips of her daughters. Golden yellow 
are her rice fields, golden is the harvest of her cotton and cane fields, 
golden are her oranges and mimosas. The yellow fever has been 
extirpated by her physicians and yellow journalism never flourished 
there. Yellow is the product of the Calcasieu sulphur mines, perhaps 
the greatest on earth. 

Sixteen years after the British flag was planted at Baton Rouge, 
it was hauled down, for in 1779, Spain having become an ally of France 
and the United Colonies, Governor Bernardo de Galvez came up 
from New Orleans with a force of Spaniards, Americans, Indians 
and n^[roes, and September 21, fought the only engagement of the 
American Revolution on Louisiana soil, compelling Colonel Dickson 
to surrender Fort Richmond. Thus sdl Louisiana came imder the 
Spanish flag. 

Napoleon, it will be remembered, (then '/First Consul Bona- 
parte")> compelled Spain to cede Louisiana to him in 1801. At 
once he began negotiations with the United States. Not until the 
spring of 1803 did his agent Laussat appear in the colony and not 
until November 30 did he take formal possession. That day he ran 
up the tricolor of the French republic on the flag pole in the * 'place 
d'armes" (now Jackson square) at New Orleans. Louisiana thus 
acquired its fourth flag. Its colors had already appeared at Baton 
Rouge in the British ensign, and were to appear in three other flags. 
The blue of truth in the tricolor suggests the waters of Louisiana's 
fair lakes and bayous; the white, the pure blossoms of her camellias 
and magnolias, the pure Americanism of her children; the red, the 
ardent Creole nature with its love of art, of home, of State, of country. 

Only three weeks did this new banner float, and apparently, 
only at the capital city of New Orleans. Laussat lowered it on 
December 20, 1803. and Governor W. C. C. Claiborne replaced it 
with the Stars and Stripes. As the blue, white and red descended, it 
passed the red, white and blue ascending. Thus we have the fifth 
of our series, which made the third in three weeks. November 30, 
the Spanish flag flew at dawn; the next dawn saw the French flag in 
its place, simset of December 20 gilded "Old Glory." 

The United States flag, of course, has a history of its own, and 
at that time had more stripes (17) and fewer stars (17) than at 
present. But since it is most familiar in its present form, we shall

accept it simply as the emblem of the United States and disr^:ard 
the details of its evolution. What did this emblem mean? The' 
blue field was the same blue of truth shown in the Union Jack and the 
tricolor; but since it was in the flag of a yoxmg nation, evidently it 
typified the hope that himianity was basing on this experiement in 
democracy. That this hope has not been disappointed, Albert of 
Belgium and George of England join Poincare of France today in 
assuring Woodrow Wilson. These stars mean what? A constellation 
of States certainly, and just as each State is a jewel in the crown of 
Colimibia, so do the starry jewels of domestic virtue, of hospitality, 
of industry, courage, sobriety, patriotism, art, education and gen- 
erosity adorn the brow of Louisiana. Not only the purity of America's 
purpose and the ardor of her patriotism are denoted, by these stripes 
but they are also the ladder of worthy deeds, whereby Louisianians as 
citizens of both State and Nation climb toward the goal of progress. 
Indubitably, Louisiana's most flourishing epochs have been those 
wten she has been without question beneath the aegis of Columbia, 
namely, from 1803 to 1861 and since 1865. 

While Govemor.Claibome and his associates were busy organiz- 
ing the government of the territory of Orleans, at Baton Rouge the 
scarlet and saffron of Spain still waved, and Spanish officials pursued 
the even tenor of their way. Don Carlos de Grandpre was the 
Governor, but in 1808 he was succeeded by Don Carlos de Hault de 
Lassus and Don Louis de Grandpre became conmiandant of the little 
fort at Baton Rouge. This stood on the same site previously occu- 
pied by Fort Richmond, and before that the French fort. On and 
about it, between 1820 and 1830 were erected the buildings of the 
United States arsenal and garrison, now part of the equipment of 
Louisiana State University. Once again the influence of Napoleon— 
now emporer of the French — affected the history of Louisiana. 
In 1808 he placed his brother, Joseph, on the throne of Spain. Soon 
in the Spanish colonies ''juntas," or committees of the colonists, 
loyal to the house of Bourbon, undertook to carry on the colonial 
government until the restoration of Ferdinand VII. Such a com- 
mittee was organized at the 'Tlains," a few miles ncMth of Baton 
Rouge, in July, 1810. In September, however, the Anglo-Americans 
in the province of West Florida held a convention and took the step 
that from 1814 to 1825 the other Spanish colonies were to take. 
''General" Philemon Thomas — a veteran of the American Revolu- 
tion — was sent with an "army" of one hundred to capture the garri- 
son at Baton Rouge. This was done, the gallant Grandpre being 
mysteriously slain, and the governor captured. This date, September

23, 1810, marked the appearance of the "Republic of West Florida," 
whose ensign, the sixth in our series, was the first "lone star" flag in 
American history, being a blue woollen field with a single silver star 
in the centre. Fulwar Skipwith was soon elected governor of the 
republic, which applied for annexation to the United States as a 
new commonwealth. President Madison believed that this region 
had been included in the Louisiana purchase, so directed Governor 
Claiborne to administer it as part of the territory of Orleans, which 
he began doing in December, 1810. Two years later, that portion 
of the old West Florida province (and "republic") between the lakes, 
the Mississippi and Pearl rivers, and the present State of Mississippi, 
entered the Union as part of the State of Louisiana; whence the name 
"Florida parishes." In the language of a distinguished descendant 
of some of the West Florida revolutionists, "the Stars and Stripes 
replaced the argent star on the blue field; the government of the free 
State peacefully dissolved; its troops disbanded and its citizens en- 
rolled themselves among the truest and staunchest of the Great 
Republic."* 

Blue, deep blue, like the skies of Louisiana, was this sixth banner, 
and silver as the clear notes of her mocking birds was the star. Note 
how often this true blue thread appears in her history, and the silver 
or grey or white, whether of ptuity, or of magnolia bloom, or of the 
fogs of the Father of Waters, recurs again and again. 

Louisianians followed the flag of the Union in the War of 1812, 
the Seminole and Mexican wars, displaying the virtues symbolized 
by these six banners. Perhaps this was why the seventh and the 
eighth, like the sixth, were to be bom of war, and like it, destined to 
be short lived. 

Once again, as in 1810, Baton Rouge was the scene of a declara- 
tion of independence. The convention of Louisiana, on January 
26, 1861, adopted the ordinance of secession, and Louisiana wa^ 
proclaimed a free and independent State. A committee was ordered 
to design a national flag for her, which was adopted early in February, 
and until Louisiana entered the Confederacy in March, was the 
emblem of her "sovereignty." The committee declared that they 
were trying, in this "national flag of the State of Louisiana" to 
epitomize all her previous flags. Let us see if they succeeded. The 
design was a standard of thirteen stripes of blue (4), white (6), and 
red (3), in that order, with a field of red in the upper, inner corner, 
containing a single star of pale yellow. It will be seen at a glance 


that this flag contains the white and gold of the Bourbon oiiflamme, 
while the lone yellow star in the red field suggests both the colors <rf 
Spain and the single star of West Florida. Stripes of blue, white 
and red remind us of the banners of Britain and the French republic, 
while the mystic nimiber thirteen was borrowed from Old Glory. 
It will sooti appear that the committee was prcq>hetic as well as 
historic in its instincts, since the flag also contains the colcn^ of the 
State's other two flags. Probably the complicated nature of this 
flag symbolizes the racial elements in Louisiana's population. Among 
the whites we find first the Creoles— pure whites of French or ^)anish 
descent, then Anglo-Americans, people oi German, Dutch, Portu- 
guese, Italian, Greek, Scandinavian, Russian, Armenian and Balkan 
extraction, with many intermarriages among these various dements. 
There are a few Hindus, some Indians, many Mcmgolians and large 
ntmibers of n^roes. 

Soon the eighth flag appeared, rel^ating the seventh to the 
rank of a State flag. Of course the eighth was the banner of the 
Confederacy. Like some others, it had several forms, but the best 
known and most popular was the crimson field with a blue St. Andrew's 
cross, bordered witii white and bearing thirteen white stars. These 
colors have already been interpreted sufficiently, but the cross 
suggests the religious fervor with which Louisiana threw hersdf 
into the struggle for Southern irdependence. It symbolizes also 
the heavy cross she bore during Reconstruction. 

Early in 1862, it was superseded by the Stars and Stripes in the 
southern part of the State, and this gradually penetrated north and 
westward tmtil in 1865 it waved everywho^. Today tho^ is not a 
Louisianian who does not pray that the Stars and Stripes will ccm- 
tinue to float over the State as long as mankind endures. 

These eight flags were the emblems of imits claiming independent 
sovereignty. Cur ninth is that of a sub-division of a nation — ^the 
well-known "Pelican flag" of the State of Louisiana. While it seems 
that various flags hearing pelicans — sometimes red flags, sometimes 
blue — ^had been used at deferent times by military companies and 
other organizations, and the pelican design was suggested to the 
convention of 1861, it was not imtil after Reconstruction that the 
present, blue pelican flag came into general use, and not tmtil Jtily 
1, 1912 did the legislature officially and fOTmally declare it the 
State flag. General John McGrath, ex-president of the Historical 
Society of East and West Baton Rouge, is inclined to think, that 
since no convention ever rescinded the adoption of the "synoptical"

flag of 1861, it is still the official State flag, while the Pelican flag is 
merely the governor's headquarters standard. 

The sjnnbolism of the Pelican flag is, of course, very clear. The 
blue field signifies both truth and hope, and Louisiana is true to 
American ideals and optimistic as to her futiu^. The motto : Union, 
Justice, Confidence, speaks for itself. The design of the Pelican 
feeding the young in the nest is based on the legend that in time of 
famine this mother plucked the flesh from her breast to nourish her 
fledglings. Equally devoted is Louisiana to her children and so from 
her bosom — ^her fertile fields — does she draw their sustenance. 

We have seen that at one time or another, over all or part of the 
present State of Louisiana, at least nine flags have floated. Having 
glanced in a figurative manner at their symbolism, let us try for a 
moment to see what actual contributions to the State's development 
these banners suggest. Beginning with France, we derive the name, 
the Creole and Acadian elements in the p(q>ulation, the French 
elements the language, the civil law, the literature, the menu and 
the art of Louisiana, with the gracious personal traits of the Gaul, 
and the large Catholic element in her population. Such place-names 
as Orleans. Terrebonne, Lafayette, Thibodaux, Iberville, Pontchar- 
train, are redolent of "la Belle France." Martin and Moreau-Lislet 
in law, Etienne de Bor6 in sugar manufacturing, Madeleine Hachard 
and Pere AUouez in religion, Mcweau Gottschalk in music, Alc6e 
Fcwtier in literature, Chaill6 in medicine, Audubon in science, Jean 
Louis in philanthropy, Mouton and Hebert in politics, Blanchard, 
Beauregard, Lejeime, in war, Julien Poydras in agriculture and 
philanthropy, are enough to illustrate the rich and varied contribu- 
tions of France to the making of Louisiana. Matas in surgery, 
Unzaga and Miro in government, Galvez and Desoto on the map, 
Gayarr6 in history, Penalvert y Cardenas in religion, Almonaster in 
philanthropy, Bermudez in law, Quintero in journalism, are typical 
of the Spanish element in her history. From the United States Louis- 
iana derived such jurists as Edward Livingston and E. D. White, 
such auth<H-s as Grace King and George W. Cable, such educators as 
James W. Nicholson, the mathematician, David F. Boyd, sometime 
president of Louisiana State University, A. B. Dinwiddie, president 
of Tulane; such clergymen as B. M. Palmer and Max Heller, and the 
Protestant religion, such soldiers as * Dick" Taylor and Franklyn 
Gardner, such diplomatists as J. B. Eustis, the first American am- 
bassador to France; such philanthropists as John McDonogh and 
Judah Touro. The English language is part of Louisiana's heritage 
from Britain, while Judah P. Benjamin, **the brains of the Confed-

eracy," was born under the British flag, as w^-e Mr. William Beer 
of the Howard Memorial Library, and Professor W. H. Dalrymple, 
the noted scientist. Many of the West Florida revolutionists were 
English loyalists who had fled to that province during the Revolu- 
tion, but who preferred American rule to Spanish. With the "lone 
star" flag we associate Philemon Thomas, of course, who later en- 
tered the State legislature, and commanded the Baton Rouge militia 
at the battle of New Orleans. John Rhea, Fulwar Skipwith and 
other members of this revolutionary party were the ancestors of 
many prominent Louisianians of today. Two of the first city council- 
men (1818) of Baton Rouge were veterans of this revolution — 
William Williams and Hugh Crawford. 

With the Confederate flag we naturally associate Generals 
P. G. T, Beauregard, "Dick" Taylor, Braxton Bragg; Duncan F. 
Kenner, president of the convention of 1861, and a member of the 
Confederate Congress; Governors T. O. Moore and Henry Watkins 
Allen, Judah P. Benjamin and P. A. Rost. While many noted 
Louisianians first attained prominence during the era of the Confed- 
eracy, their greatest services were rendered in the epoch of the 
Pelican flag, especially during Reconstruction. Amongst them were 
Governor and Senator S. D. McEnery, Governors F. T. Nicholls 
and L. A. Wiltz, E. D. White, Chief Justice of the United States, the 
author Ruth McEnery Stuart, and educators like Boyd and Nichol- 
son. Belonging entirely to the Pelican flag period are State Superin- 
tendent Thomas H. Harris, Governor Ruffin G. Pleasant, Dr. Oscar 
Dowhng, the wonder-working president of the State Board of Health, 
Miss Sophie B. Wright, Mrs. John Dibert, John M. Parker, Dr. 
Rudolpdi Matas, Bishop Davis Sessums, and many distinguished 
soldiers, sailors and marines in the World War, of whom a few of the 
more prominent are General John A. Lejeune, Colonels F. P. Stubbs, 
C. B. Hodges, Sanderford Jarman, Ogden Fuqua and Major O. W. 
McNeese. 

Flags are, of themselves, nothing: as emblems they are signifi- 
cant. It is hoped that this brief essay has shown that each of Louis- 
iana's nine flags is emblematic of positive and valuable contributions 
to American civilization. Louisiana is proud of every one of her 
flags. But she wishes for no more, and so far as her efforts can secure 
that end, the Stars and Stripes and the Pelican will wave side by side 
from her capitol until time shall be no more.
