    <h1>STRANGE TRUE STORIES OF LOUISIANA.</h1>
    <h2>HOW I GOT THEM.</h2>
    <h3>1882-89.</h3>
    <p>True stories are not often good art. The relations and
      experiences of real
      men and women rarely fall in such symmetrical order as to make an
      artistic
      whole. Until they have had such treatment as we give stone in the
      quarry
      or gems in the rough they seldom group themselves with that
      harmony of
      values and brilliant unity of interest that result when art comes
      in&#8212;not
      so much to transcend nature as to make nature transcend herself.</p>
    <p>Yet I have learned to believe that good stories happen oftener
      than once I
      thought they did. Within the last few years there have dropped
      into my
      hands by one accident or another a number of these natural
      crystals, whose
      charms, never the same in any two, are in each and all enough at
      least to
      warn off all tampering of the fictionist. Happily, moreover,
      without being
      necessary one to another, they yet have a
      <!-- Page 2 -->coherent sequence, and follow
      one another like the days of a week. They are mine only by right
      of
      discovery. From various necessities of the case I am sometimes the
      story-teller, and sometimes, in the reader's interest, have to
      abridge;
      but I add no fact and trim naught of value away. Here are no
      unconfessed
      "restorations," not one. In time, place, circumstance, in every
      essential
      feature, I give them as I got them&#8212;strange stories that truly
      happened,
      all partly, some wholly, in Louisiana.</p>
    <p>In the spring of 1883, being one night the guest of my friend Dr.
      Francis
      Bacon, in New Haven, Connecticut, and the conversation turning, at
      the
      close of the evening, upon wonderful and romantic true happenings,
      he
      said:</p>
    <p>"You are from New Orleans; did you never hear of Salome
      M&uuml;ller?"</p>
    <p>"No."</p>
    <p>Thereupon he told the story, and a few weeks later sent me by
      mail, to my
      home in New Orleans, whither I had returned, a transcription,
      which he had
      most generously made, of a brief summary of the case&#8212;it would be
      right to
      say tragedy instead of case&#8212;as printed in "The Law Reporter" some
      forty
      years ago. That transcription lies before me now, beginning, "The
      Supreme
      Court of the State of Louisiana has lately been called upon to
      investigate
      and decide one of the most interesting cases which has ever come
      under the
      cognizance of a judicial tribunal." This episode, which had been
      the cause
      of public excitement within the memory of men still living on the
      <!-- Page 3 -->scene,
      I, a native resident of New Orleans and student of its history,
      stumbled
      upon for the first time nearly two thousand miles from home.</p>
    <p>I mentioned it to a number of lawyers of New Orleans, one after
      another.
      None remembered ever having heard of it. I appealed to a former
      chief-justice of the State, who had a lively personal remembrance
      of every
      member of the bench and the bar concerned in the case; but of the
      case he
      had no recollection. One of the medical experts called in by the
      court for
      evidence upon which the whole merits of the case seemed to hang
      was still
      living&#8212;the distinguished Creole physician, Dr. Armand Mercier. He
      could
      not recall the matter until I recounted the story, and then only
      in the
      vaguest way. Yet when my friend the former chief-justice kindly
      took down
      from his shelves and beat free of dust the right volume of supreme
      court
      decisions, there was the terse, cold record, No. 5623. I went to
      the old
      newspaper files under the roof of the city hall, and had the
      pleasure
      speedily to find, under the dates of 1818 and 1844, such passing
      allusions
      to the strange facts of which I was in search as one might hope to
      find in
      those days when a serious riot was likely to receive no mention,
      and a
      steamboat explosion dangerously near the editorial rooms would be
      recorded
      in ten lines of colorless statement. I went to the courts, and,
      after
      following and abandoning several false trails through two days'
      search,
      found that the books of record containing the object of my quest
      had been
      lost, having unaccountably disappeared in&#8212;if I remember
      aright&#8212;1870.</p>
    <!-- Page 4 -->
    <p>There was one chance left: it was to find the original papers. I
      employed
      an intelligent gentleman at so much a day to search till he should
      find
      them. In the dusty garret of one of the court buildings&#8212;the old
      Spanish
      Cabildo, that faces Jackson Square&#8212;he rummaged for ten days,
      finding now
      one desired document and now another, until he had gathered all
      but one.
      Several he drew out of a great heap of papers lying in the middle
      of the
      floor, as if it were a pile of rubbish; but this one he never
      found. Yet I
      was content. Through the perseverance of this gentleman and the
      intervention of a friend in the legal profession, and by the
      courtesy of
      the court, I held in my hand the whole forgotten story of the poor
      lost
      and found Salome M&uuml;ller. How through the courtesy of some of
      the
      reportorial staff of the "New Orleans Picayune" I found and
      conversed with
      three of Salome's still surviving relatives and friends, I shall
      not stop
      to tell.</p>
    <p>While I was still in search of these things, the editor of the
      "New
      Orleans Times-Democrat" handed me a thick manuscript, asking me to
      examine
      and pronounce upon its merits. It was written wholly in French, in
      a
      small, cramped, feminine hand. I replied, when I could, that it
      seemed to
      me unfit for the purposes of transient newspaper publication, yet
      if he
      declined it I should probably buy it myself. He replied that he
      had
      already examined it and decided to decline it, and it was only to
      know
      whether I, not he, could use it that I had been asked to read it.</p>
    <!-- Page 5 -->
    <p>I took it to an attorney, and requested him, under certain strict
      conditions, to obtain it for me with all its rights.</p>
    <p>"What is it?"</p>
    <p>"It is the minute account, written by one of the travelers, a
      pretty
      little Creole maiden of seventeen, of an adventurous journey made,
      in
      1795, from New Orleans through the wilds of Louisiana, taking six
      weeks to
      complete a tour that could now be made in less than two days."</p>
    <p>But this is written by some one else; see, it says</p>
    <p class="center"><img src="hwimg01.jpg" alt="Voyage de ma
        grand'mere"></p>
    <p>"Yes," I rejoined, "it purports to be a copy. We must have the
      little
      grandmother's original manuscript, written in 1822; that or
      nothing."</p>
    <p>So a correspondence sprang up with a gentle and refined old
      Creole lady
      with whom I later had the honor to become acquainted and now count
      among
      my esteemed friends&#8212;grand-daughter of the grandmother who, after
      innumerable recountings by word of mouth to mother, sisters,
      brothers,
      friends, husband, children, and children's children through
      twenty-seven
      years of advancing life, sat down at last and wrote the oft-told
      tale for
      her little grand-children, one of whom, inheriting her literary
      instinct
      and herself become an aged grandmother, discovers the manuscript
      among
      some old family papers and recognizes its value. The first
      exchange of
      letters
      <!-- Page 6 -->disclosed the fact that the "New Orleans Bee"
      ("L'Abeille") had
      bought the right to publish the manuscript in French; but the
      moment its
      editors had proper assurance that there was impending another
      arrangement
      more profitable to her, they chivalrously yielded all they had
      bought, on
      merely being reimbursed.</p>
    <p>The condition that required the delivery of the original
      manuscript,
      written over sixty years before, was not so easily met. First came
      the
      assurance that its spelling was hideous, its writing bad and
      dimmed by
      time, and the sheets tattered and torn. Later followed the
      disclosure that
      an aged and infirm mother of the grandmother owned it, and that
      she had
      some time before compelled its return to the private drawer from
      which the
      relic-loving daughter had abstracted it. Still later came a letter
      saying
      that since the attorney was so relentlessly exacting, she had
      written to
      her mother praying her to part with the manuscript. Then followed
      another
      communication,&#8212;six large, closely written pages of
      despair,&#8212;inclosing a
      letter from the mother. The wad of papers, always more and more in
      the way
      and always "smelling bad," had been put into the fire. But a
      telegram
      followed on the heels of the mail, crying joy! An old letter had
      been
      found and forwarded which would prove that such a manuscript had
      existed.
      But it was not in time to intercept the attorney's letter saying
      that, the
      original manuscript being destroyed, there could be no purchase or
      any
      need of further correspondence. The old letter came. It was
      genuine beyond
      a doubt, had been
      <!-- Page 7 -->written by one of the party making the journey, and
      was
      itself forty-seven years old. The paper was poor and sallow, the
      hand-writing large, and the orthography&#8212;!</p>

    <p>But let us translate:</p>
    <p>st. john baptist<a name="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1">[1]</a>
      10 august 1836
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>My very dear Niece. I received your letter this morning in which
      you ask
      me to tell you what I remember of the journey to Attakapas made in
      1795 by
      papa, M. &#8212;&#8212;-, [and] my younger sister Fran&ccedil;oise afterward
      your
      grandmother. If it were with my tongue I could answer more
      favorably; but
      writing is not my forte; I was never calculated for a public
      writer, as
      your grandmother was. By the way, she wrote the journey, and very
      prettily; what have you done with it? It is a pity to lose so
      pretty a
      piece of writing.... We left New Orleans to go to the Attakapas in
      the
      month of May, 1795, and in an old barge ["vieux chalant qui
      sent&eacute; le rat
      mord a plien nez"]. We were Fran&ccedil;oise and I Suzanne, pearl
      of the family,
      and Papa, who went to buy lands; and one Joseph Charpentier and
      his dear
      and pretty little wife Alix [whom] I love so much; 3 Irish, father
      mother
      and son [fice]; lastly Mario, whom you knew, with Celeste,
      formerly lady's
      maid to Marianne&#8212;who is now my sister-in-law.... If I knew better
      how to
      write I
      <!-- Page 8 -->would tell you our adventures the alligators tried
      to devour us.
      We barely escaped perishing in Lake Chicot and many other
      things.... At
      last we arrived at a pretty village St. Martinville called also
      little
      Paris and full of barons, marquises, counts and countesses<a
        name="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2">[2]</a> that were an
      offense to my nose and my stomach. Your grandmother was in
      raptures. It
      was there we met the beautiful Tonton, your aunt by marriage. I
      have a bad
      finger and must stop.... Your loving aunty [ta tantine qui temme]</p>
    <p>Suzanne &#8212;&#8212; n&eacute;e &#8212;&#8212;</p>
    <p>The kind of letter to expect from one who, as a girl of eighteen,
      could
      shoot and swim and was called by her father "my son"; the antipode
      of her
      sister Fran&ccedil;oise. My attorney wrote that the evidence was
      sufficient.</p>
    <p>His letter had hardly got into the mail-bag when another telegram
      cried
      hold! That a few pages of the original manuscript had been found
      and
      forwarded by post. They came. They were only nine in all&#8212;old,
      yellow,
      ragged, torn, leaves of a plantation account-book whose red-ruled
      columns
      had long ago faded to a faint brown, one side of two or three of
      them
      preoccupied with charges in bad French of yards of cottonade,
      "mouslin &agrave;
      dames," "jaconad," dozens of soap, pounds of tobacco, pairs of
      stockings,
      lace, etc.; but to our great pleasure each page corresponding
      closely,
      save in orthography and syntax, with a page of the new manuscript,
      and the
      page numbers of the
      <!-- Page 9 -->old running higher than those of the new! Here was
      evidence which one could lay before a skeptical world that the
      transcriber
      had not expanded the work of the original memoirist. The
      manuscript passed
      into my possession, our Creole lady-correspondent reiterating to
      the end
      her inability to divine what could be wanted with "an almost
      illegible
      scrawl" (griffonage), full of bad spelling and of rather inelegant
      diction. But if old manuscript was the object of desire, why, here
      was
      something else; the very document alluded to by Fran&ccedil;oise
      in her memoir of
      travel&#8212;the autobiography of the dear little countess, her beloved
      Alix de
      Morainville, made fatherless and a widow by the guillotine in the
      Reign of
      Terror.</p>
    <p>"Was that all?" inquired my agent, craftily, his suspicions
      aroused by the
      promptness with which the supply met the demand. "Had she not
      other old
      and valuable manuscripts?"</p>
    <p>"No, alas! Only that one."</p>
    <p>Thus reassured, he became its purchaser. It lies before me now,
      in an
      inner wrapper of queer old black paper, beside its little
      tight-fitting
      bag, or case of a kind of bright, large-flowered silken stuff not
      made in
      these days, and its outer wrapper of discolored brief-paper; a
      pretty
      little document of sixty-eight small pages in a feminine hand,
      perfect in
      its slightly archaic grammar, gracefully composed, and, in spite
      of its
      flimsy yellowed paper, as legible as print: "Histoire d'Alix de
      Morainville &eacute;crite &agrave; la Louisiane ce 22 Aout 1795.
      Pour mes ch&egrave;res amies,
      Suzanne et Fran&ccedil;oise Bossier."</p>
    <!-- Page 10 -->
    <p>One day I told the story to Professor Charles Eliot Norton of
      Harvard
      University. He generously offered to see if he could find the name
      of the
      Count de Morainville on any of the lists of persons guillotined
      during the
      French Revolution. He made the search, but wrote, "I am sorry to
      say that
      I have not been able to find it either in Prudhomme, 'Dictionnaire
      des
      Individues envoy&eacute;s &agrave; la Mort judiciairement,
      1789-1796,' or in the list
      given by Wallon in the sixth volume of his very interesting
      'Histoire du
      Tribunal Revolutionnaire de Paris.' Possibly he was not put to
      death in
      Paris," etc. And later he kindly wrote again that he had made some
      hours'
      further search, but in vain.</p>
    <p>Here was distress. I turned to the little manuscript roll of
      which I had
      become so fond, and searched its pages anew for evidence of either
      genuineness or its opposite. The wrapper of black paper and the
      close-fitting silken bag had not been sufficient to keep it from
      taking on
      the yellowness of age. It was at least no modern counterfeit.
      Presently I
      noticed the total absence of quotation marks from its passages of
      conversation. Now, at the close of the last century, the use of
      quotation
      marks was becoming general, but had not become universal and
      imperative.
      Their entire absence from this manuscript of sixty-eight pages,
      abounding
      in conversations, meant either age or cunning pretense. But would
      a
      pretender carry his or her cunning to the extreme of fortifying
      the
      manuscript in every possible way against the sallowing touch of
      time, lay
      it away in a trunk of old papers, lie
      <!-- Page 11 -->down and die without mentioning it,
      and leave it for some one in the second or third generation
      afterward to
      find? I turned the leaves once more, and lo! one leaf that had had
      a large
      corner torn off had lost that much of its text; it had been
      written upon
      before it was torn; while on another torn leaf, for there are two,
      the
      writing reads&#8212;as you shall see&#8212;uninterruptedly around the torn
      edge; the
      writing has been done after the corner was torn off. The two
      rents,
      therefore, must have occurred at different times; for the one
      which
      mutilates the text is on the earlier page and surely would not
      have been
      left so by the author at the time of writing it, but only by some
      one
      careless of it, and at some time between its completion and the
      manifestly
      later date, when it was so carefully bestowed in its old-fashioned
      silken
      case and its inner wrapper of black paper. The manuscript seemed
      genuine.
      Maybe the name De Morainville is not, but was a convenient fiction
      of Alix
      herself, well understood as such by Fran&ccedil;oise and Suzanne.
      Everything
      points that way, as was suggested at once by Madame Sidonie de la
      Houssaye
      &#8212;There! I have let slip the name of my Creole friend, and can only
      pray
      her to forgive me! "Tout porte &agrave; le croire" (Everything
      helps that
      belief), she writes; although she also doubts, with reason, I
      should say,
      the exhaustive completeness of those lists of the guillotined. "I
      recall,"
      she writes in French, "that my husband has often told me the two
      uncles of
      his father, or grandfather, were guillotined in the Revolution;
      but though
      <!-- Page 12 -->search was made by an advocate, no trace of them
      was found in any
      records."</p>
    <p>An assumed name need not vitiate the truth of the story; but
      discoveries
      made since, which I am still investigating, offer probabilities
      that,
      after all, the name is genuine.</p>
    <p>We see, however, that an intention to deceive, were it
      supposable, would
      have to be of recent date.</p>
    <p>Now let me show that an intention to deceive could not be of
      recent date,
      and at the same time we shall see the need of this minuteness of
      explanation. Notice, then, that the manuscript comes directly from
      the
      lady who says she found it in a trunk of her family's private
      papers. A
      prominent paper-maker in Boston has examined it and says that,
      while its
      age cannot be certified to from its texture, its leaves are of
      three
      different kinds of paper, each of which might be a hundred years
      old. But,
      bluntly, this lady, though a person of literary tastes and talent,
      who
      recognized the literary value of Alix's <i>history</i>, esteemed
      original
      <i>documents</i> so lightly as, for example, to put no value upon
      Louisa
      Cheval's thrilling letter to her brother. She prized this Alix
      manuscript
      only because, being a simple, succinct, unadorned narrative, she
      could use
      it, as she could not Fran&ccedil;oise's long, pretty story, for
      the foundation of
      a nearly threefold expanded romance. And this, in fact, she had
      written,
      copyrighted, and arranged to publish when our joint experience
      concerning
      Fran&ccedil;oise's manuscript at length readjusted her sense of
      values. She sold
      me the little Alix manuscript at a price still out of all
      proportion below
      <!-- Page 13 -->her valuation of her own writing, and counting it
      a mistake that the
      expanded romance should go unpreferred and unpublished.</p>
    <p>But who, then, wrote the smaller manuscript? Madame found it, she
      says, in
      the possession of her very aged mother, the daughter and namesake
      of
      Fran&ccedil;oise. Surely she was not its author; it is she who
      said she burned
      almost the whole original draft of Fran&ccedil;oise's "Voyage,"
      because it was
      "in the way and smelt bad." Neither could Fran&ccedil;oise have
      written it. Her
      awkward handwriting, her sparkling flood of words and details, and
      her
      ignorance of the simplest rules of spelling, make it impossible.
      Nor could
      Suzanne have done it. She wrote and spelled no better at
      fifty-nine than
      Fran&ccedil;oise at forty-three. Nor could any one have imposed it
      on either of
      the sisters. So, then, we find no intention to deceive, either
      early or
      recent. I translated the manuscript, it went to the magazine, and
      I sat
      down to eat, drink, and revel, never dreaming that the brazen
      water-gates
      of my Babylon were standing wide open.</p>
    <p>For all this time two huge, glaring anachronisms were staring me,
      and half
      a dozen other persons, squarely in the face, and actually escaping
      our
      notice by their serene audacity. But hardly was the pie&#8212;I mean the
      magazine&#8212;opened when these two birds began to sing. Wasn't
      that&#8212;interesting? Of course Louis de la Houssaye, who in 1786 "had
      lately
      come from San Domingo," had <i>not</i> "been fighting the
      insurgents"&#8212;who did
      not revolt until four or five years afterward! And of course the
      old
      count, who so kindly
      <!-- Page 14 -->left the family group that was bidding Madelaine
      de
      Livilier good-bye, was not the Prime Minister Maurepas, who was <i>not</i>
      "only a few months returned from exile," and who was <i>not</i>
      then "at the
      pinnacle of royal favor"; for these matters were of earlier date,
      and this
      "most lovable old man in the world" wasn't any longer in the world
      at all,
      and had not been for eight years. He was dead and buried.</p>
    <p>And so, after all, fraudulent intent or none, <i>this</i>
      manuscript, just as
      it is, could never have been written by Alix. On "this 22d of
      August,
      1795," she could not have perpetrated such statements as these
      two. Her
      memory of persons and events could not have been so grotesquely at
      fault,
      nor could she have hoped so to deceive any one. The misstatements
      are of
      later date, and from some one to whom the two events were
      historical. But
      the manuscript is all in one simple, undisguised, feminine
      handwriting,
      and with no interlineation save only here and there the correction
      of a
      miswritten word.</p>
    <p>Now in translating madame's "Voyage de ma Grandm&egrave;re," I
      noticed something
      equivalent to an interlineation, but in her own writing like all
      the rest,
      and added in a perfectly unconcealed, candid manner, at the end of
      a
      paragraph near the close of the story. It struck me as an innocent
      gloss
      of the copyist, justified in her mind by some well-credited family
      tradition. It was this: "Just as we [Fran&ccedil;oise and Alix]
      were parting, she
      [Alix] handed me the story of her life." I had already called my
      friend's
      attention to the anachronisms, and she was in keen distress,
      because
      totally
      <!-- Page 15 -->unable to account for them. But as I further
      pondered them, this
      gloss gained new significance and I mentioned it. My new inquiry
      flashed
      light upon her aged memory. She explained at once that, to connect
      the two
      stories of Fran&ccedil;oise and Alix, she had thought it right to
      impute these
      few words to Fran&ccedil;oise rather than for mere exactness to
      thrust a detailed
      explanation of her own into a story hurrying to its close. My
      question
      called back an incident of long ago and resulted first in her
      rummaging a
      whole day among her papers, and then in my receiving the
      certificate of a
      gentleman of high official standing in Louisiana that, on the 10th
      of last
      April (1889), this lady, in his presence, took from a large trunk
      of
      written papers, variously dated and "appearing to be perfectly
      genuine," a
      book of memoranda from which, writes he, "I copy the following
      paragraph
      written by Madame S. de la Houssaye herself in the middle of the
      book, on
      page 29." Then follows in French:</p>
    <p>June 20, 1841.&#8212;M. Gerbeau has dined here again. What a singular
      story he
      tells me. We talked of my grandmother and Madame Carpentier, and
      what does
      M. Gerbeau tell me but that Alix had not finished her history when
      my
      grandmother and my aunt returned, and that he had promised to get
      it to
      them. "And I kept it two years for want of an opportunity," he
      added. How
      mad Grandmamma must have been! How the delay must have made her
      suffer!</p>
    <p>Well and good! Then Alix did write her story! But if she wrote
      for both
      her "dear and good friends," Suzanne and Fran&ccedil;oise, then
      Fran&ccedil;oise, the
      younger and milder sister, would the more likely have to be
      <!-- Page 16 -->content,
      sooner or later, with a copy. This, I find no reason to doubt, is
      what
      lies before me. Indeed, here (crossed out in the manuscript, but
      by me
      restored and italicized) are signs of a copyist's pen: "Mais
      helas! il
      desesperoit de reussir quand' <i>il desespe</i> rencontra," etc.
      Is not that a
      copyist's repetition? Or this:"&#8212;et lui, mon mari apres tout se fit
      mon
      <i>marim</i> domestique." And here the copyist misread the
      original: "Lorsque
      le maire entendit les noms et les <i>personnes</i> prenoms de la
      mari&eacute;e," etc.
      In the manuscript personnes is crossed out, and the correct word,
      prenoms,
      is written above it.</p>
    <p>Whoever made this copy it remains still so simple and compact
      that he or
      she cannot be charged with many embellishments. And yet it is easy
      to
      believe that some one, with that looseness of family tradition and
      largeness of ancestral pride so common among the Creoles, in
      half-knowledge and half-ignorance should have ventured aside for
      an
      instant to attribute in pure parenthesis to an ancestral De la
      Houssaye
      the premature honor of a San Domingan war; or, incited by some
      tradition
      of the old Prime Minister's intimate friendship with Madelaine's
      family,
      should have imputed a gracious attention to the wrong Count de
      Maurepas,
      or to the wrong count altogether.</p>
    <p>I find no other theory tenable. To reject the whole matter as a
      forgery
      flies into the face of more incontestable facts than the
      anachronisms do.
      We know, from Suzanne and Fran&ccedil;oise, without this
      manuscript, that there
      was an Alix Carpentier, daughter of a count, widow of a viscount,
      an
      <i>emigr&eacute;e</i> of the Revolution,
      <!-- Page 17 -->married to a Norman peasant, known to M.
      Gerbeau, beloved of Suzanne and Fran&ccedil;oise, with whom they
      journeyed to
      Attakapas, and who wrote for them the history of her strange life.
      I hold
      a manuscript carefully kept by at least two generations of
      Fran&ccedil;oise's
      descendants among their valuable private papers. It professes to
      be that
      history&#8212;a short, modest, unadorned narrative, apparently a copy of
      a
      paper of like compass, notwithstanding the evident insertion of
      two
      impossible statements whose complete omission does not disturb the
      narrative. I see no room to doubt that it contains the true story
      of a
      real and lovely woman. But to come back to my attorney.</p>
    <p>While his grave negotiations were still going on, there met me
      one evening
      at my own gate a lady in black, seeking advice concerning her wish
      to sell
      to some publisher a private diary never intended for publication.</p>
    <p>"That kind is the best," I said. "Did you write it during the
      late war?" I
      added at a guess.</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"I suppose, then, it contains a careful record of each day's
      public
      events."</p>
    <p>"No, I'm sorry to say&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Nay, don't be sorry; that lack may save it from the
      waste-basket." Then
      my heart spoke. "Ah! madam, if you had only done what no woman
      seems to
      have seen the importance of doing&#8212;written the women's side of that
      awful
      war&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"That's just what I have done," she interrupted.
      <!-- Page 18 -->"I was a Union woman, in
      the Confederacy. I couldn't talk; I had to write. I was in the
      siege of
      Vicksburg from beginning to end."</p>
    <p>"Leave your manuscript with me," I said. "If, on examining it, I
      find I
      can recommend it to a publisher, I will do so. But remember what I
      have
      already told you&#8212;the passage of an unknown writer's work through
      an older
      author's hands is of no benefit to it whatever. It is a bad sign
      rather
      than a good one. Your chances of acceptance will be at least no
      less if
      you send this to the publishers yourself."</p>
    <p>No, she would like me to intervene.</p>
    <p>How my attorney friend and I took a two days' journey by rail,
      reading the
      manuscript to each other in the Pullman car; how a young newly
      married
      couple next us across the aisle, pretending not to notice,
      listened with
      all their might; how my friend the attorney now and then stopped
      to choke
      down tears; and how the young stranger opposite came at last, with
      apologies, asking where this matter would be published and under
      what
      title, I need not tell. At length I was intercessor for a
      manuscript that
      publishers would not lightly decline. I bought it for my little
      museum of
      true stories, at a price beyond what I believe any magazine would
      have
      paid&#8212;an amount that must have filled the widow's heart with joy,
      but as
      certainly was not beyond its worth to me. I have already
      contributed a
      part of this manuscript to "The Century" as one of its
      "Wax-papers." But
      by permission it is restored here to its original place.</p>
    <!-- Page 19 -->
    <p>Judge Farrar, with whom I enjoyed a slight but valued
      acquaintance,
      stopped me one day in Carondelet street, New Orleans, saying, "I
      have a
      true story that I want you to tell. You can dress it out&#8212;"</p>
    <p>I arrested him with a shake of the head. "Dress me no dresses.
      Story me no
      stories. There's not one of a hundred of them that does not lack
      something
      essential, for want of which they are good for naught. Keep them
      for
      after-dinner chat; but for the novelist they are good to smell,
      not to
      eat. And yet&#8212;tell me your story. I have a use for it&#8212;a cabinet of
      true
      things that have never had and shall not have a literary tool
      lifted up
      against them; virgin shells from the beach of the sea of human
      events. It
      may be I shall find a place for it there." So he told me the true
      story
      which I have called "Attalie Brouillard," because, having
      forgotten the
      woman's real name, it pleased his fancy to use that name in
      recounting the
      tale: "Attalie Brouillard." I repeated the story to a friend, a
      gentleman
      of much reading.</p>
    <p>His reply dismayed me. "I have a faint impression," he said,
      "that you
      will find something very much like that in one of Lever's novels."</p>
    <p>But later I thought, "Even so, what then? Good stories repeat
      themselves."
      I remembered having twice had experiences in my own life the
      accounts of
      which, when given, would have been great successes only that they
      were old
      anecdotes&#8212;great in their day, but long worn out in the club-rooms
      and
      abandoned to clergymen's reunions. The wise thing was not to find
      out or
      care whether Lever had somewhere
      <!-- Page 20 -->told something like it, but whether the
      story was ever a real event in New Orleans, and, if so, to add it
      to my
      now, to me, priceless collection. Meeting the young judge again, I
      asked
      boldly for the story's full authentication. He said promptly that
      the man
      who told it of his own knowledge was the late Judge T. Wharton
      Collins;
      that the incidents occurred about 1855, and that Judge McCaleb
      could
      doubtless give the name of the notary public who had been an actor
      in the
      affair. "Let us go to his office right now," said my obliging
      friend.</p>
    <p>We went, found him, told him our errand. He remembered the story,
      was
      confident of its entire verity, and gave a name, which, however,
      he begged
      I would submit for verification to an aged notary public in
      another
      street, a gentleman of the pure old Creole type. I went to him. He
      heard
      the story through in solemn silence. From first to last I
      mentioned no
      name, but at the end I asked:</p>
    <p>"Now, can you tell me the name of the notary in that case?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>I felt a delicious tingling as I waited for the disclosure. He
      slowly
      said:</p>
    <p>"Dthere eeze wan troub' 'bout dat. To <i>which</i> case do you <i>riffer?
        'Cause,
        you know, dey got t'ree, four case' like dat</i>. An' you better
      not mention
      no name, 'cause you don't want git nobody in troub', you know.
      Now dthere's dthe case of&#8212;&#8212;. And dthere's dthe case of&#8212;&#8212;. And
      dthere's
      the case of&#8212;&#8212;. He had to go away; yes; 'cause when <i>he</i> make
      dthe dade
      man make his will, he git <i>behine</i> dthe dade man in bade,
      an' hole 'im up
      in dthe bade."</p>
    <p>I thanked him and departed, with but the one regret that the tale
      was true
      so many more times than was necessary.</p>
    <p>In all this collection the story of the so-called haunted house
      in Royal
      street is the only one that must ask a place in literature as
      partly a
      twice-told tale. The history of the house is known to thousands in
      the old
      French quarter, and that portion which antedates the late war was
      told in
      brief by Harriet Martineau as far back as when she wrote her book
      of
      American travel. In printing it here I fulfill an oft-repeated
      promise;
      for many a one has asked me if I would not, or, at least, why I
      did not,
      tell its dark story.</p>
    <p>So I have inventoried my entire exhibit&#8212;save one small matter. It
      turned
      out after, all that the dear old Creole lady who had sold us the
      ancient
      manuscript, finding old paper commanding so much more per ton than
      it ever
      had commanded before, raked together three or four more
      leaves&#8212;stray
      chips of her lovely little ancestress Fran&ccedil;oise's workshop,
      or rather the
      shakings of her basket of cherished records,&#8212;to wit, three Creole
      African
      songs, which I have used elsewhere; one or two other scraps, of no
      value;
      and, finally, a long letter telling its writer's own short story&#8212;a
      story
      so tragic and so sad that I can only say pass it, if you will. It
      stands
      first because it antedates the rest. As you will see, its time is
      something more than a hundred years ago. The writing was very
      difficult to
      read, owing entirely to the badness&#8212;mainly the softness&#8212;of the
      paper. I
      have tried in vain to find exactly where Fort Latourette was
      situated. It
      may have had but a momentary existence in Galvez's campaign
      against the
      English. All along the Gulf shore the sites and remains of the
      small forts
      once held by the Spaniards are known traditionally and
      indiscriminately as
      "Spanish Fort." When John Law,&#8212;author of that famed Mississippi
      Bubble,
      which was in Paris what the South Sea Bubble was in London,&#8212;failed
      in his
      efforts at colonization on the Arkansas, his Arkansas settlers
      came down
      the Mississippi to within some sixty miles of New Orleans and
      established
      themselves in a colony at first called the <i>C&ocirc;te
        Allemande</i> (German
      Coast), and later, owing to its prosperity, the <i>C&ocirc;te
        d'Or</i>, or Golden
      Coast. Thus the banks of the Mississippi became known on the
      Rhine, a
      goodly part of our Louisiana Creoles received a German tincture,
      and the
      father and the aunt of Suzanne and Fran&ccedil;oise were not the
      only Alsatians
      we shall meet in these wild stories of wild times in Louisiana.</p>

    <h2>THE ADVENTURES OF FRAN&Ccedil;OISE AND SUZANNE.</h2>
    <h3>1795.</h3>
    <p>Years passed by. Our war of the Revolution was over. The Indians
      of
      Louisiana and Florida were all greedy, smiling gift-takers of his
      Catholic
      Majesty. So were some others not Indians; and the Spanish
      governors of
      Louisiana, scheming with them for the acquisition of Kentucky and
      the
      regions intervening, had allowed an interprovincial commerce to
      spring up.
      Flatboats and barges came floating down the Mississippi past the
      plantation home where little Suzanne and Fran&ccedil;oise were
      growing up to
      womanhood. Many of the immigrants who now came to Louisiana were
      the
      royalist <i>noblesse</i> flying from the horrors of the French
      Revolution.
      Governor Carondelet was strengthening his fortifications around
      New
      Orleans; for Creole revolutionists had slipped away to Kentucky
      and were
      there plotting an armed descent in flatboats upon his little
      capital,
      where the rabble were singing the terrible songs of bloody Paris.
      Agents
      of the Revolution had come from France and so "contaminated," as
      he says,
      "the greater part of the province" that he kept order only "at the
      cost
      of sleepless nights, by frightening some, punishing others, and
      driving
      several out of the colony." It looks as though Suzanne had caught
      a touch
      of dis-relish for <i>les aristocrates</i>, whose necks the songs
      of the day
      were promising to the lampposts. To add to all these commotions, a
      hideous
      revolution had swept over San Domingo; the slaves in Louisiana had
      heard
      of it, insurrection was feared, and at length, in 1794, when
      Susanne was
      seventeen and Fran&ccedil;oise fifteen, it broke out on the
      Mississippi no great
      matter over a day's ride from their own home, and twenty-three
      blacks were
      gibbeted singly at intervals all the way down by their father's
      plantation
      and on to New Orleans, and were left swinging in the weather to
      insure the
      peace and felicity of the land. Two other matters are all we need
      notice
      for the ready comprehension of Fran&ccedil;oise's story.
      Immigration was knocking
      at every gate of the province, and citizen &Eacute;tienne de
      Bor&eacute; had just made
      himself forever famous in the history of Louisiana by producing
      merchantable sugar; land was going to be valuable, even back on
      the wild
      prairies of Opelousas and Attakapas, where, twenty years before,
      the
      Acadians,&#8212;the cousins of Evangeline,&#8212;wandering from far Nova
      Scotia, had
      settled. Such was the region and such were the times when it began
      to be
      the year 1795.</p>
    <p>By good fortune one of the undestroyed fragments of
      Fran&ccedil;oise's own
      manuscript is its first page. She was already a grandmother
      forty-three
      years old when in 1822 she wrote the tale she had so often told.
      Part of
      the dedication to her only daughter and namesake&#8212;one line,
      possibly
      two&#8212;has been torn off, leaving only the words, "ma fille unique a
      la
      grasse [meaning 'grace'] de dieu [sic]," over her signature and
      the date,
      "14 Julet [sic], 1822."</p>

    <h3>THE TWO SISTERS.</h3>
    <p>It is to give pleasure to my dear daughter Fannie and to her
      children that
      I write this journey. I shall be well satisfied if I can succeed
      in giving
      them this pleasure: by the grace of God, Amen.</p>
    <p>Papa, Mr. Pierre Bossier, planter of St. James parish, had been
      fifteen
      days gone to the city (New Orleans) in his skiff with two rowers,
      Louis
      and Baptiste, when, returning, he embraced us all, gave us some
      caramels
      which he had in his pockets, and announced that he counted on
      leaving us
      again in four or five days to go to Attakapas. He had long been
      speaking
      of going there. Papa and mamma were German, and papa loved to
      travel. When
      he first came to Louisiana it was with no expectation of staying.
      But here
      he saw mamma; he loved her, married her, and bought a very fine
      plantation, where he cultivated indigo. You know they blue clothes
      with
      that drug, and dye cottonade and other things. There we, their
      eight
      children, were born....</p>

    <p class="center"><img src="img04.jpg" alt="PART OF
        FRAN&Ccedil;OIS'S FIRST PAGE."></p>
    <p>When my father used to go to New Orleans he went in his skiff,
      with a
      canopy over his head to keep off the sun, and two rowers, who sang
      as
      they rowed. Sometimes papa took me with him, and it was very
      entertaining.
      We would pass the nights of our voyage at the houses of papa's
      friends
      [des zami de papa]. Sometimes mamma would come, and Suzanne
      always&#8212;always. She was the daughter next older than I. She barely
      missed
      being a boy. She was eighteen years of age, went hunting with our
      father,
      was skillful with a gun, and swam like a fish. Papa called her "my
      son."
      You must understand the two boys were respectively but two years
      and three
      months old, and papa, who greatly desired a son, had easily made
      one of
      Suzanne. My father had brought a few books with him to Louisiana,
      and
      among them, you may well suppose, were several volumes of travel.
      For
      myself, I rarely touched them; but they were the only books that
      Suzanne
      read. And you may well think, too, that my father had no sooner
      spoken of
      his intention than Suzanne cried:</p>
    <p>"I am going with you, am I not, papa?"</p>
    <p>"Naturally," replied my father; "and Fran&ccedil;oise shall go
      also."</p>
    <p>Fran&ccedil;oise&#8212;that was I; poor child of sixteen, who had but
      six months
      before quitted the school-bench, and totally unlike my
      sister&#8212;blonde,
      where Suzanne was dark; timid, even cowardly, while she had the
      hardihood
      and courage of a young lioness; ready to cry at sight of a wounded
      bird,
      while she, gun in hand, brought down as much game as the most
      skillful
      hunter.</p>
    <p>I exclaimed at my father's speech. I had heard there were many
      Indians in
      Attakapas; the name means man-eaters. I have a foolish terror of
      Indians,
      and a more reasonable one for man-eaters. But papa and Suzanne
      mocked at
      my fears; and as, after all, I burned with desire for the journey,
      it was
      decided that I should go with them.</p>
    <p>Necessarily we wanted to know how we were to go&#8212;whether we should
      travel
      by skiff, and how many negroes and negresses would go with us. For
      you
      see, my daughter, young people in 1795 were exactly what they are
      in 1822;
      they could do nothing by themselves, but must have a domestic to
      dress and
      undress them. Especially in traveling, where one had to take
      clothes out
      of trunks and put them back again, assistance became an absolute
      necessity. Think, then, of our astonishment, of our vexation, when
      papa
      assured us that he would not take a single slave; that my sister
      and I
      would be compelled to help each other, and that the skiff would
      remain
      behind, tied up at the landing where it then lay.</p>
    <p>"But explain yourself, Papa, I beg of you," cried Suzanne, with
      her
      habitual petulance.</p>
    <p>"That is what I am trying to do," said he. "If you will listen in
      silence,
      I will give you all the explanation you want."</p>
    <p>Here, my daughter, to save time, I will borrow my father's speech
      and tell
      of the trip he had made to New Orleans; how he had there found
      means to
      put into execution his journey to Attakapas, and the companions
      that were
      to accompany him.</p>

    <h2>II.</h2>
    <h3>MAKING UP THE EXPEDITION.</h3>
    <p>In 1795 New Orleans was nothing but a mere market town. The
      cathedral, the
      convent of the Ursulines, five or six caf&eacute;s, and about a
      hundred houses
      were all of it.<a name="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote6">[6]</a>
      Can you believe, there were but two dry-goods stores!
      And what fabulous prices we had to pay! Pins twenty dollars a
      paper. Poor
      people and children had to make shift with thorns of orange and
      <i>amourette</i> [honey locust?]. A needle cost fifty cents, very
      indifferent
      stockings five dollars a pair, and other things accordingly.</p>
    <p>On the levee was a little pothouse of the lowest sort; yet from
      that
      unclean and smoky hole was destined to come one of the finest
      fortunes in
      Louisiana. They called the proprietor "P&egrave;re la Chaise."<a
        name="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote7">[7]</a> He was a
      little
      old marten-faced man, always busy and smiling, who every year laid
      aside
      immense profits. Along the crazy walls extended a few rough
      shelves
      covered with bottles and decanters. Three planks placed on boards
      formed
      the counter, with P&egrave;re la Chaise always behind it. There
      were two or three
      small tables, as many chairs, and one big wooden bench. Here
      gathered the
      city's working-class, and often among them one might find a goodly
      number
      of the city's &eacute;lite; for the wine and the beer of the old <i>cabaretier</i>
      were famous, and one could be sure in entering there to hear all
      the news
      told and discussed.</p>
    <p>By day the place was quiet, but with evening it became
      tumultuous. P&egrave;re la
      Chaise, happily, did not lose his head; he found means to satisfy
      all, to
      smooth down quarrels without calling in the police, to get rid of
      drunkards, and to make delinquents pay up.</p>
    <p>My father knew the place, and never failed to pay it a visit when
      he went
      to New Orleans. Poor, dear father! he loved to talk as much as to
      travel.
      P&egrave;re la Chaise was acquainted with him. One evening papa
      entered, sat down
      at one of the little tables, and bade P&egrave;re la Chaise bring
      a bottle of his
      best wine. The place was already full of people, drinking,
      talking, and
      singing. A young man of twenty-six or twenty-seven entered almost
      timidly
      and sat down at the table where my father was&#8212;for he saw that all
      the
      other places were occupied&#8212;and ordered a half-bottle of cider. He
      was a
      Norman gardener. My father knew him by sight; he had met him here
      several
      times without speaking to him. You recognized the peasant at once;
      and yet
      his exquisite neatness, the gentleness of his face, distinguished
      him from
      his kind. Joseph Carpentier was dressed<a name="FNanchor8"></a><a
        href="#Footnote8">[8]</a> in a very ordinary gray woolen
      coat; but his coarse shirt was very white, and his hair, when he
      took off
      his broad-brimmed hat, was well combed and glossy.</p>
    <p>As Carpentier was opening his bottle a second frequenter entered
      the
      <i>cabaret</i>. This was a man of thirty or thirty-five, with
      strong features
      and the frame of a Hercules. An expression of frankness and gayety
      overspread his sunburnt face. Cottonade pantaloons, stuffed into a
      pair of
      dirty boots, and a <i>vareuse</i> of the same stuff made up his
      dress. His
      vareuse, unbuttoned, showed his breast, brown and hairy; and a
      horrid cap
      with long hair covered, without concealing, a mass of red locks
      that a
      comb had never gone through. A long whip, the stock of which he
      held in
      his hand, was coiled about his left arm. He advanced to the
      counter and
      asked for a glass of brandy. He was a drayman named John Gordon&#8212;an
      Irishman.</p>
    <p>But, strange, John Gordon, glass in hand, did not drink;
      Carpentier, with
      his fingers round the neck of the bottle, failed to pour his
      cider; and my
      father himself, his eyes attracted to another part of the room,
      forgot his
      wine. Every one was looking at an individual gesticulating and
      haranguing
      in the middle of the place, to the great amusement of all. My
      father
      recognized him at first sight. He was an Italian about the age of
      Gordon;
      short, thick-set, powerful, swarthy, with the neck of a bull and
      hair as
      black as ebony. He was telling rapidly, with strong gestures, in
      an almost
      incomprehensible mixture of Spanish, English, French, and Italian,
      the
      story of a hunting party that he had made up five years before.
      This was
      Mario Carlo. A Neapolitan by birth, he had for several years
      worked as a
      blacksmith on the plantation of one of our neighbors, M. Alphonse
      Perret.
      Often papa had heard him tell of this hunt, for nothing could be
      more
      amusing than to listen to Carlo. Six young men, with Carlo as
      sailor and
      cook, had gone on a two-months' expedition into the country of the
      Attakapas.</p>
    <p>"Yes," said the Italian, in conclusion, "game never failed us;
      deer,
      turkeys, ducks, snipe, two or three bears a week. But the
      sublimest thing
      was the rich land. Ah! one must see it to believe it. Plains and
      forests
      full of animals, lakes and bayous full of fish. Ah! fortune is
      there. For
      five years I have dreamed, I have worked, with but one object in
      view; and
      today the end is reached. I am ready to go. I want only two
      companions to
      aid me in the long journey, and those I have come to look for
      here."</p>
    <p>John Gordon stepped forward, laid a hand upon the speaker's
      shoulder, and
      said:</p>
    <p>"My friend, I am your man."</p>
    <p>Mario Carlo seized the hand and shook it with all his force.</p>
    <p>"You will not repent the step. But"&#8212;turning again to the
      crowd&#8212;"we want
      one more."</p>
    <p>Joseph Carpentier rose slowly and advanced to the two men.
      "Comrades, I
      will be your companion if you will accept me."</p>
    <p>Before separating, the three drank together and appointed to meet
      the next
      day at the house of Gordon, the Irishman.</p>
    <p>When my father saw Gordon and Carpentier leave the place, he
      placed his
      hand on Mario's shoulder and said in Italian, "My boy, I want to
      talk with
      you."</p>
    <p>At that time, as now, parents were very scrupulous as to the
      society into
      which they introduced their children, especially their daughters;
      and papa
      knew of a certain circumstance in Carlo's life to which my mother
      might
      greatly object. But he knew the man had an honest and noble heart.
      He
      passed his arm into the Italian's and drew him to the inn where my
      father
      was stopping, and to his room. Here he learned from Mario that he
      had
      bought one of those great barges that bring down provisions from
      the West,
      and which, when unloaded, the owners count themselves lucky to
      sell at any
      reasonable price. When my father proposed to Mario to be taken as
      a
      passenger the poor devil's joy knew no bounds; but it disappeared
      when
      papa added that he should take his two daughters with him.</p>
    <p>The trouble was this: Mario was taking with him in his flatboat
      his wife
      and his four children; his wife and four children were
      simply&#8212;mulattoes.
      However, then as now, we hardly noticed those things, and the idea
      never
      entered our minds to inquire into the conduct of our slaves.
      Suzanne and I
      had known Celeste, Mario's wife, very well before her husband
      bought her.
      She had been the maid of Marianne Perret, and on great occasions
      Marianne
      had sent her to us to dress our hair and to prepare our toilets.
      We were
      therefore enchanted to learn that she would be with us on board
      the
      flatboat, and that papa had engaged her services in place of the
      attendants we had to leave behind.</p>
    <p>It was agreed that for one hundred dollars Mario Carlo would
      receive all
      three of us as passengers, that he would furnish a room simply but
      comfortably, that papa would share this room with us, that Mario
      would
      supply our table, and that his wife would serve as maid and
      laundress. It
      remained to be seen now whether our other fellow-travelers were
      married,
      and, if so, what sort of creatures their wives were.</p>
    <p>[The next day the four intended travelers met at Gordon's house.
      Gordon
      had a wife, Maggie, and a son, Patrick, aged twelve, as unlovely
      in
      outward aspect as were his parents. Carpentier, who showed himself
      even
      more plainly than on the previous night a man of native
      refinement,
      confessed to a young wife without offspring. Mario told his story
      of love
      and alliance with one as fair of face as he, and whom only cruel
      law
      forbade him to call wife and compelled him to buy his children;
      and told
      the story so well that at its close the father of Fran&ccedil;oise
      silently
      grasped the narrator's hand, and Carpentier, reaching across the
      table
      where they sat, gave his, saying:</p>
    <p>"You are an honest man, Monsieur Carlo."</p>
    <p>"Will your wife think so?" asked the Italian.</p>
    <p>"My wife comes from a country where there are no prejudices of
      race."</p>
    <p>Fran&ccedil;oise takes the pains to say of this part of the story
      that it was not
      told her and Suzanne at this time, but years afterward, when they
      were
      themselves wives and mothers. When, on the third day, her father
      saw
      Carpentier's wife at the Norman peasant's lodgings, he was greatly
      surprised at her appearance and manner, and so captivated by them
      that he
      proposed that their two parties should make one at table during
      the
      projected voyage&#8212;a proposition gratefully accepted. Then he left
      New
      Orleans for his plantation home, intending to return immediately,
      leaving
      his daughters in St. James to prepare for the journey and await
      the
      arrival of the flatboat, which must pass their home on its way to
      the
      distant wilds of Attakapas.]</p>

    <h2>III.</h2>
    <h3>THE EMBARKATION</h3>
    <p>You see, my dear child, at that time one post-office served for
      three
      parishes: St. James, St. John the Baptist, and St. Charles. It was
      very
      far from us, at the extremity of St. John the Baptist, and the
      mail came
      there on the first of each month.</p>
    <p>We had to pay&#8212;though the price was no object&#8212;fifty cents postage
      on a
      letter. My father received several journals, mostly European.
      There was
      only one paper, French and Spanish, published in New Orleans&#8212;"The
      Gazette."<a name="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote9">[9]</a> To
      send to the post-office was an affair of state. Our
      father, you see, had not time to write; he was obliged to come to
      us
      himself. But such journeys were a matter of course in those days.</p>
    <p>"And above all things, my children," said my father, "don't have
      too much
      baggage."</p>
    <p>I should not have thought of rebelling; but Suzanne raised loud
      cries,
      saying it was an absolute necessity that we go with papa to New
      Orleans,
      so as not to find ourselves on our journey without
      traveling-dresses, new
      neckerchiefs, and a number of things. In vain did poor papa
      endeavor to
      explain that we were going into a desert worse than Arabia;
      Suzanne put
      her two hands to her ears and would hear nothing, until, weary of
      strife,
      poor papa yielded.</p>
    <p>Our departure being decided upon, he wished to start even the
      very next
      day; and while we were instructing our sisters Elinore and Marie
      concerning some trunks that we should leave behind us, and which
      they must
      pack and have ready for the flatboat, papa recommended to mamma a
      great
      slaughter of fowls, etc., and especially to have ready for
      embarkation two
      of our best cows. Ah! in those times if the planter wished to live
      well he
      had to raise everything himself, and the poultry yard and the
      dairy were
      something curious to see. Dozens of slaves were kept busy in them
      constantly. When my mother had raised two thousand chickens,
      besides
      turkeys, ducks, geese, guinea-fowls, and pea-fowls, she said she
      had lost
      her crop.<a name="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote10">[10]</a>
      And the quantity of butter and cheese! And all this without
      counting the sauces, the jellies, the preserves, the gherkins, the
      syrups,
      the brandied fruits. And not a ham, not a chicken, not a pound of
      butter
      was sold; all was served on the master's table, or, very often,
      given to
      those who stood in need of them. Where, now, can you find such
      profusion?
      Ah! commerce has destroyed industry.</p>
    <p>The next day, after kissing mamma and the children, we got into
      the large
      skiff with papa and three days later stepped ashore in New
      Orleans. We
      remained there a little over a week, preparing our
      traveling-dresses.
      Despite the admonitions of papa, we went to the fashionable
      modiste of the
      day, Madame Cinthelia Lefranc, and ordered for each a suit that
      cost one
      hundred and fifty dollars. The costume was composed of a petticoat
      of
      <i>camayeu</i>, very short, caught up in puffs on the side by a
      profusion of
      ribbons; and a very long-pointed black velvet jacket (<i>casaquin</i>),
      laced
      in the back with gold and trimmed on the front with several rows
      of gilt
      buttons. The sleeves stopped at the elbows and were trimmed with
      lace.
      Now, my daughter, do you know what camayeu was? You now sometimes
      see an
      imitation of it in door and window curtains. It was a stuff of
      great
      fineness, yet resembling not a little the unbleached cotton of
      to-day, and
      over which were spread very brilliant designs of prodigious size.
      For
      example, Suzanne's petticoat showed bunches of great radishes&#8212;not
      the
      short kind&#8212;surrounded by long, green leaves and tied with a yellow
      cord;
      while on mine were roses as big as a baby's head, interlaced with
      leaves
      and buds and gathered into bouquets graced with a blue ribbon. It
      was ten
      dollars an ell; but, as the petticoats were very short, six ells
      was
      enough for each. At that time real hats were unknown. For driving
      or for
      evening they placed on top of the high, powdered hair what they
      called a
      <i>catogan</i>, a little bonnet of gauze or lace trimmed with
      ribbons; and
      during the day a sun-bonnet of silk or velvet. You can guess that
      neither
      Suzanne nor I, in spite of papa's instructions, forgot these.</p>
    <p>Our traveling-dresses were gray <i>cirsacas</i>,&#8212;the skirt all
      one, short,
      without puffs; the jacket coming up high and with long sleeves,&#8212;a
      sunbonnet of cirsacas, blue stockings, embroidered handkerchief or
      blue
      cravat about the neck, and high-heeled shoes.</p>
    <p>As soon as Celeste heard of our arrival in New Orleans she
      hastened to us.
      She was a good creature; humble, respectful, and always ready to
      serve.
      She was an excellent cook and washer, and, what we still more
      prized, a
      lady's maid and hairdresser of the first order. My sister and I
      were glad
      to see her, and overwhelmed her with questions about Carlo, their
      children, their plans, and our traveling companions.</p>
    <p>"Ah! Momzelle Suzanne, the little Madame Carpentier seems to me a
      fine
      lady, ever so genteel; but the Irish woman! Ah! <i>grand Dieu!</i>
      she puts me
      in mind of a soldier. I'm afraid of her. She smokes&#8212;she swears&#8212;she
      carries a pistol, like a man."</p>
    <p>At last the 15th of May came, and papa took us on board the
      flatboat and
      helped us to find our way to our apartment. If my father had
      allowed
      Carlo, he would have ruined himself in furnishing our room; but
      papa
      stopped him and directed it himself. The flatboat had been divided
      into
      four chambers. These were covered by a slightly arching deck, on
      which the
      boat was managed by the moving of immense sweeps that sent her
      forward.
      The room in the stern, surrounded by a sort of balcony, which
      Monsieur
      Carpentier himself had made, belonged to him and his wife; then
      came ours,
      then that of Celeste and her family, and the one at the bow was
      the
      Irishwoman's. Carlo and Gordon had crammed the provisions, tools,
      carts,
      and plows into the corners of their respective apartments. In the
      room
      which our father was to share with us he had had Mario make two
      wooden
      frames mounted on feet. These were our beds, but they were
      supplied with
      good bedding and very white sheets. A large cypress table, on
      which we saw
      a pile of books and our workboxes; a washstand, also of cypress,
      but well
      furnished and surmounted by a mirror; our trunks in a corner;
      three
      rocking-chairs&#8212;this was all our furniture. There was neither
      carpet nor
      curtain.</p>
    <p>All were on board except the Carpentier couple. Suzanne was all
      anxiety to
      see the Irishwoman. Poor Suzanne! how distressed she was not to be
      able to
      speak English! So, while I was taking off my <i>capotte</i>&#8212;as
      the sun-bonnet
      of that day was called&#8212;and smoothing my hair at the glass, she had
      already tossed her capotte upon papa's bed and sprung up the
      ladder that
      led to the deck. (Each room had one.) I followed a little later
      and had
      the satisfaction of seeing Madame Margaretto Gordon, commonly
      called
      "Maggie" by her husband and "Maw" by her son Patrick. She was
      seated on a
      coil of rope, her son on the boards at her feet. An enormous dog
      crouched
      beside them, with his head against Maggie's knee. The mother and
      son were
      surprisingly clean. Maggie had on a simple brown calico dress and
      an
      apron of blue ticking. A big red kerchief was crossed on her
      breast and
      its twin brother covered her well combed and greased black hair.
      On her
      feet were blue stockings and heavy leather shoes. The blue ticking
      shirt
      and pantaloons and waistcoat of Master Pat were so clean that they
      shone;
      his black cap covered his hair&#8212;as well combed as his mother's; but
      he was
      barefooted. Gordon, Mario, and Celeste's eldest son, aged
      thirteen, were
      busy about the deck; and papa, his cigar in his mouth and his
      hands in his
      pockets, stood looking out on the levee. I sat down on one of the
      rough
      benches that had been placed here and there, and presently my
      sister came
      and sat beside me.</p>
    <p>"Madame Carpentier seems to be a laggard," she said. She was
      burning to
      see the arrival of her whom we had formed the habit of calling
      "the little
      French peasant."</p>
    <p>[Presently Suzanne begins shooting bonbons at little Patrick,
      watching the
      effect out of the corners of her eyes, and by and by gives that
      smile, all
      her own,&#8212;to which, says Fran&ccedil;oise, all flesh invariably
      surrendered,&#8212;and
      so became dumbly acquainted; while Carlo was beginning to swear
      "fit to
      raise the dead," writes the memoirist, at the tardiness of the
      Norman
      pair. But just then&#8212;]</p>
    <p>A carriage drove up to within a few feet of our <i>chaland</i>
      and Joseph
      Carpentier alighted, paid the driver, and lifted from it one so
      delicate,
      pretty, and small that you might take her at first glance for a
      child of
      ten years. Suzanne and I had risen quickly and came and leaned
      over the
      balustrade. To my mortification my sister had passed one arm
      around the
      waist of the little Irishman and held one of his hands in hers.
      Suzanne
      uttered a cry of astonishment. "Look, look, Fran&ccedil;oise!" But
      I was looking,
      with eyes wide with astonishment.</p>
    <p>The gardener's wife had alighted, and with her little gloved hand
      shook
      out and re-arranged her toilet. That toilet, very simple to the
      eyes of
      Madame Carpentier, was what petrified us with astonishment. I am
      going to
      describe it to you, my daughter.</p>
    <p>We could not see her face, for her hood of blue silk, trimmed
      with a light
      white fur, was covered with a veil of white lace that entirely
      concealed
      her features. Her traveling-dress, like ours, was of cirsacas, but
      ours
      was cotton, while hers was silk, in broad rays of gray and blue;
      and as
      the weather was a little cool that morning, she had exchanged the
      unfailing casaquin for a sort of <i>camail</i> to match the
      dress, and trimmed,
      like the capotte, with a line of white fur. Her petticoat was very
      short,
      lightly puffed on the sides, and ornamented only with two very
      long
      pockets trimmed like the camail. Below the folds of the robe were
      two
      Cinderella feet in blue silk stockings and black velvet slippers.
      It was
      not only the material of this toilet that astonished us, but the
      way in
      which it was made.</p>
    <p>"Maybe she is a modiste. Who knows?" whispered Suzanne.</p>
    <p>Another thing: Madame Carpentier wore a veil and gloves, two
      things of
      which we had heard but which we had never seen. Madame Ferrand had
      mentioned them, but said that they sold for their weight in gold
      in Paris,
      and she had not dared import them, for fear she could not sell
      them in
      Louisiana. And here was the wife of a laboring gardener, who
      avowed
      himself possessor of but two thousand francs, dressed like a
      duchess and
      with veil and gloves!</p>
    <p>I could but notice with what touching care Joseph assisted his
      wife on
      board. He led her straight to her room, and quickly rejoined us on
      deck to
      put himself at the disposition of his associates. He explained to
      Mario
      his delay, caused by the difficulty of finding a carriage; at
      which Carlo
      lifted his shoulders and grimaced. Joseph added that madame&#8212;I
      noticed
      that he rarely called her Alix&#8212;was rather tired, and would keep
      her room
      until dinner time. Presently our heavy craft was under way.</p>
    <p>Pressing against the long sweeps, which it required a herculean
      strength
      to move, were seen on one side Carlo and his son Celestino, or
      'Tino, and
      on the other Joseph and Gordon. It moved slowly; so slowly that it
      gave
      the effect of a great tortoise.</p>

    <h2>IV.</h2>
    <h3>ALIX CARPENTIER</h3>
    <p>Towards noon we saw Celeste come on deck with her second son,
      both
      carrying baskets full of plates, dishes, covers, and a tablecloth.
      You
      remember I have often told you of an awning stretched at the stern
      of the
      flatboat? We found that in fine weather our dining-room was to be
      under
      this. There was no table; the cloth was simply spread on the deck,
      and
      those who ate had to sit <i>&agrave; la Turque</i> or take their
      plates on their
      knees. The Irish family ate in their room. Just as we were drawing
      around
      our repast Madame Carpentier, on her husband's arm, came up on
      deck.</p>
    <p>Dear little Alix! I see you yet as I saw you then. And here,
      twenty-seven
      years after our parting, I have before me the medallion you gave
      me, and
      look tenderly on your dear features, my friend!</p>
    <p>She had not changed her dress; only she had replaced her camail
      with a
      scarf of blue silk about her neck and shoulders and had removed
      her gloves
      and <i>capuche</i>. Her rich chestnut hair, unpowdered, was
      combed back <i>&agrave; la
        Chinoise</i>, and the long locks that descended upon her
      shoulders were tied
      by a broad blue ribbon forming a rosette on the forepart of her
      head. She
      wore no jewelry except a pearl at each ear and her wedding ring.
      Suzanne,
      who always saw everything, remarked afterward that Madame
      Carpentier wore
      two.</p>
    <p>"As for her earrings," she added, "they are nothing great.
      Marianne has
      some as fine, that cost, I think, ten dollars."</p>
    <p>Poor Suzanne, a judge of jewelry! Madame Carpentier's earrings
      were two
      great pearls, worth at least two hundred dollars. Never have I met
      another
      so charming, so lovely, as Alix Carpentier. Her every movement was
      grace.
      She moved, spoke, smiled, and in all things acted differently from
      all the
      women I had ever met until then. She made one think she had lived
      in a
      world all unlike ours; and withal she was simple, sweet, good, and
      to love
      her seemed the most natural thing on earth. There was nothing
      extraordinary in her beauty; the charm was in her intelligence and
      her
      goodness.</p>
    <p>Maggie, the Irishwoman, was very taciturn. She never mingled with
      us, nor
      spoke to any one except Suzanne, and to her in monosyllables only
      when
      addressed. You would see her sometimes sitting alone at the bow of
      the
      boat, sewing, knitting, or saying her beads. During this last
      occupation
      her eyes never quitted Alix. One would say it was to her she
      addressed her
      prayers; and one day, when she saw my regard fixed upon Alix, she
      said to
      me:</p>
    <p>"It does me good to look at her; she must look like the Virgin
      Mary."</p>
    <p>Her little form, so graceful and delicate, had, however, one
      slight
      defect; but this was hidden under the folds of her robe or of the
      scarf
      that she knew how to arrange with such grace. One shoulder was a
      trifle
      higher than the other.</p>
    <p>After having greeted my father, whom she already knew, she turned
      to us,
      hesitated a moment, and then, her two little hands extended, and
      with a
      most charming smile, she advanced, first to me and then to
      Suzanne, and
      embraced us both as if we had been old acquaintances. And from
      that moment
      we were good friends.</p>
    <p>It had been decided that the boat should not travel by night,
      notwithstanding the assurance of Carlo, who had a map of
      Attakapas. But in
      the Mississippi there was no danger; and as papa was pressed to
      reach our
      plantation, we traveled all that first night.</p>
    <p>The next day Alix&#8212;she required us to call her by that
      name&#8212;invited us to
      visit her in her room. Suzanne and I could not withhold a cry of
      surprise
      as we entered the little chamber. (Remember one thing: papa took
      nothing
      from home, not knowing even by what means we should return; but
      the
      Carpentiers were going for good and taking everything.) Joseph had
      had the
      rough walls whitewashed. A cheap carpet&#8212;but high-priced in those
      times&#8212;of bright colors covered the floor; a very low French bed
      occupied
      one corner, and from a sort of dais escaped the folds of an
      embroidered
      bobbinet mosquito-bar. It was the first mosquito-bar of that kind
      we had
      ever seen. Alix explained that she had made it from the curtains
      of the
      same bed, and that both bed and curtains she had brought with her
      from
      England. New mystery!</p>
    <p>Beside the bed a walnut dressing-table and mirror, opposite to it
      a
      washstand, at the bed's foot a <i>pr&iacute;edieu</i>, a
      center-table, three
      chairs&#8212;these were all the furniture; but [an enumeration follows
      of all
      manner of pretty feminine belongings, in crystal, silver, gold,
      with a
      picture of the crucifixion and another of the Virgin]. On the
      shelves were
      a rich box of colors, several books, and some portfolios of music.
      From a
      small peg hung a guitar.</p>
    <p>But Suzanne was not satisfied. Her gaze never left an object of
      unknown
      form enveloped in green serge. Alix noticed, laughed, rose, and,
      lifting
      the covering, said:</p>
    <p>"This is my harp, Suzanne; later I will play it for you."</p>
    <p>The second evening and those that followed, papa, despite Carlo's
      representation and the magnificent moonlight, opposed the
      continuation of
      the journey by night; and it was not until the morning of the
      fifth day
      that we reached St. James.</p>
    <p>You can fancy the joy with which we were received at the
      plantation. We
      had but begun our voyage, and already my mother and sisters ran to
      us with
      extended arms as though they had not seen us for years. Needless
      to say,
      they were charmed with Alix; and when after dinner we had to say a
      last
      adieu to the loved ones left behind, we boarded the flatboat and
      left the
      plantation amid huzzas,<a name="FNanchor11"></a><a
        href="#Footnote11">[11]</a> waving handkerchiefs, and kisses
      thrown from
      finger-tips. No one wept, but in saying good-bye to my father, my
      mother
      asked:</p>
    <p>"Pierre, how are you going to return?"</p>
    <p>"Dear wife, by the mercy of God all things are possible to the
      man with
      his pocket full of money."</p>
    <p>During the few days that we passed on the Mississippi each day
      was like
      the one before. We sat on the deck and watched the slow swinging
      of the
      long sweeps, or read, or embroidered, or in the chamber of Alix
      listened
      to her harp or guitar; and at the end of another week, we arrived
      at
      Plaquemine.</p>

    <h2>V.</h2>
    <h3>DOWN BAYOU PLAQUEMINE&#8212;THE FIGHT WITH WILD NATURE</h3>
    <p>Plaquemine was composed of a church, two stores, as many
      drinking-shops,
      and about fifty cabins, one of which was the court-house. Here
      lived a
      multitude of Catalans, Acadians, negroes, and Indians. When
      Suzanne and
      Maggie, accompanied by my father and John Gordon, went ashore, I
      declined
      to follow, preferring to stay aboard with Joseph and Alix. It was
      at
      Plaquemine that we bade adieu to the old Mississippi. Here our
      flatboat
      made a d&eacute;tour and entered Bayou Plaquemine.<a
        name="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote12">[12]</a></p>
    <p>Hardly had we started when our men saw and were frightened by the
      force of
      the current. The enormous flatboat, that Suzanne had likened to a
      giant
      tortoise, darted now like an arrow, dragged by the current. The
      people of
      Plaquemine had forewarned our men and recommended the greatest
      prudence.
      "Do everything possible to hold back your boat, for if you strike
      any of
      those tree-trunks of which the bayou is full it would easily sink
      you."
      Think how reassuring all this was, and the more when they informed
      us that
      this was the first time a flatboat had ventured into the bayou!</p>
    <p>Mario, swearing in all the known languages, sought to reassure
      us, and,
      aided by his two associates, changed the manoeuvring, and with
      watchful
      eye found ways to avoid the great uprooted trees in which the
      lakes and
      bayous of Attakapas abound. But how clouded was Carpentier's brow!
      And my
      father? Ah! he repented enough. Then he realized that gold is not
      always
      the vanquisher of every obstacle. At last, thanks to Heaven, our
      flatboat
      came off victor over the snags, and after some hours we arrived at
      the
      Indian village of which you have heard me tell.</p>
    <p>If I was afraid at sight of a dozen savages among the Spaniards
      of
      Plaquemine, what was to become of me now? The bank was entirely
      covered
      with men, their faces painted, their heads full of feathers,
      moccasins on
      their feet, and bows on shoulder&#8212;Indians indeed, with women simply
      wrapped in blankets, and children without the shadow of a garment;
      and all
      these Indians running, calling to one another, making signs to us,
      and
      addressing us in incomprehensible language. Suzanne, standing up
      on the
      bow of the flatboat, replied to their signs and called with all
      the force
      of her lungs every Indian word that&#8212;God knows where&#8212;she had
      learned:</p>
    <p>"Chacounam finnan! O Choctaw! Conno Poposso!" And the Indians
      clapped
      their hands, laughing with pleasure and increasing yet more their
      gestures
      and cries.</p>
    <p>The village, about fifty huts, lay along the edge of the water.
      The
      unfortunates were not timid. Presently several came close to the
      flatboat
      and showed us two deer and some wild turkeys and ducks, the spoils
      of
      their hunting. Then came the women laden with sacks made of bark
      and full
      of blackberries, vegetables, and a great quantity of baskets;
      showing all,
      motioning us to come down, and repeating in French and Spanish,
      "Money,
      money!"</p>
    <p>It was decided that Mario and Gordon should stay on board and
      that all the
      rest of the joyous band should go ashore. My father, M.
      Carpentier, and
      'Tino loaded their pistols and put them into their belts. Suzanne
      did
      likewise, while Maggie called Tom, her bulldog, to follow her.
      Celeste
      declined to go, because of her children. As to Alix and me, a
      terrible
      contest was raging in us between fright and curiosity, but the
      latter
      conquered. Suzanne and papa laughed so about our fears that Alix,
      less
      cowardly than I, yielded first, and joined the others. This was
      too much.
      Grasping my father's arm and begging him not to leave me for an
      instant, I
      let him conduct me, while Alix followed me, taking her husband's
      arm in
      both her hands. In front marched 'Tino, his gun on his shoulder;
      after him
      went Maggie, followed by Tom; and then Suzanne and little Patrick,
      inseparable friends.</p>
    <p>Hardly had we gone a few steps when we were surrounded by a human
      wall,
      and I realized with a shiver how easy it would be for these
      savages to get
      rid of us and take all our possessions. But the poor devils
      certainly
      never thought of it: they showed us their game, of which papa
      bought the
      greater part, as well as several sacks of berries, and also
      vegetables.</p>
    <p>But the baskets! They were veritable wonders. As several of those
      that I
      bought that day are still in your possession, I will not lose much
      time
      telling of them. How those half-savage people could make things so
      well
      contrived and ornamented with such brilliant colors is still a
      problem to
      us. Papa bought for mamma thirty-two little baskets fitting into
      one
      another, the largest about as tall as a child of five years, and
      the
      smallest just large enough to receive a thimble. When he asked the
      price I
      expected to hear the seller say at least thirty dollars, but his
      humble
      reply was five dollars. For a deer he asked one dollar; for a wild
      turkey,
      twenty-five cents. Despite the advice of papa, who asked us how we
      were
      going to carry our purchases home, Suzanne and I bought, between
      us, more
      than forty baskets, great and small. To papa's question, Suzanne
      replied
      with an arch smile:</p>
    <p>"God will provide."</p>
    <p>Maggie and Alix also bought several; and Alix, who never forgot
      any one,
      bought two charming little baskets that she carried to Celeste.
      Each of
      us, even Maggie, secured a broad parti-colored mat to use on the
      deck as
      a couch <i>&agrave; la Turque</i>. Our last purchases were two
      Indian bows painted red
      and blue and adorned with feathers; the first bought by Celestino
      Carlo,
      and the other by Suzanne for her chevalier, Patrick Gordon.</p>
    <p>An Indian woman who spoke a little French asked if we would not
      like to
      visit the queen. We assented, and in a few moments she led us into
      a hut
      thatched with palmetto leaves and in all respects like the others.
      Its
      interior was disgustingly unclean. The queen was a woman quite or
      nearly a
      hundred years old. She sat on a mat upon the earth, her arms
      crossed on
      her breast, her eyes half closed, muttering between her teeth
      something
      resembling a prayer. She paid no attention to us, and after a
      moment we
      went out. We entered two or three other huts and found the same
      poverty
      and squalor. The men did not follow us about, but the women&#8212;the
      whole
      tribe, I think&#8212;marched step by step behind us, touching our
      dresses, our
      <i>capuches</i>, our jewelry, and asking for everything; and I
      felt well
      content when, standing on our deck, I could make them our last
      signs of
      adieu.</p>
    <p>Our flatboat moved ever onward. Day by day, hour by hour, every
      minute it
      advanced&#8212;slowly it is true, in the diminished current, but it
      advanced. I
      no longer knew where I was. We came at times where I thought we
      were lost;
      and then I thought of mamma and my dear sisters and my two pretty
      little
      brothers, whom I might never see again, and I was swallowed up.
      Then
      Suzanne would make fun of me and Alix would caress me, and that
      did me
      good. There were many bayous,&#8212;a labyrinth, as papa said,&#8212;and Mario
      had
      his map at hand showing the way. Sometimes it seemed
      impracticable, and it
      was only by great efforts of our men ["no zomme," says the
      original] that
      we could pass on. One thing is sure&#8212;those who traverse those same
      lakes
      and bayous to-day have not the faintest idea of what they were [il
      z&eacute;t&eacute;]
      in 1795.</p>
    <p>Great vines hung down from lofty trees that shaded the banks and
      crossed
      one another a hundred&#8212;a thousand&#8212;ways to prevent the boat's
      passage and
      retard its progress, as if the devil himself was mixed in it; and,
      frankly, I believe that he had something to do with us in that
      cavern.
      Often our emigrants were forced to take their axes and hatchets in
      hand to
      open a road. At other times tree-trunks, heaped upon one another,
      completely closed a bayou. Then think what trouble there was to
      unbar that
      gate and pass through. And, to make all complete, troops of hungry
      alligators clambered upon the sides of our flatboat with jaws open
      to
      devour us. There was much outcry; I fled, Alix fled with me,
      Suzanne
      laughed. But our men were always ready for them with their guns.</p>

    <h3>THE TWICE-MARRIED COUNTESS.</h3>
    <p>But with all the sluggishness of the flatboat, the toils, the
      anxieties,
      and the frights, what happy times, what gay moments, we passed
      together on
      the rough deck of our rude vessel, or in the little cells that we
      called
      our bedrooms.</p>
    <p>It was in these rooms, when the sun was hot on deck, that my
      sister and I
      would join Alix to learn from her a new stitch in embroidery, or
      some of
      the charming songs she had brought from France and which she
      accompanied
      with harp or guitar.</p>
    <p>Often she read to us, and when she grew tired put the book into
      my hands
      or Suzanne's, and gave us precious lessons in reading, as she had
      in
      singing and in embroidery. At times, in these moments of intimacy,
      she
      made certain half-disclosures that astonished us more and more.
      One day
      Suzanne took between her own two hands that hand so small and
      delicate and
      cried out all at once:</p>
    <p>"How comes it, Alix, that you wear two wedding rings?"</p>
    <p>"Because," she sweetly answered, "if it gives you pleasure to
      know, I have
      been twice married."</p>
    <p>We both exclaimed with surprise.</p>
    <p>"Ah!" she said, "no doubt you think me younger [bocou plus jeune]
      than I
      really am. What do you suppose is my age?"</p>
    <p>Suzanne replied: "You look younger than Fran&ccedil;oise, and she
      is sixteen."</p>
    <p>"I am twenty-three," replied Alix, laughing again and again.</p>
    <p>Another time my sister took a book, haphazard, from the shelves.
      Ordinarily [audinaremend] Alix herself chose our reading, but she
      was busy
      embroidering. Suzanne sat down and began to read aloud a romance
      entitled
      "Two Destinies."</p>
    <p>"Ah!" cried my sister, "these two girls must be Fran&ccedil;oise
      and I."</p>
    <p>"Oh no, no!" exclaimed Alix, with a heavy sigh, and Suzanne began
      her
      reading. It told of two sisters of noble family. The elder had
      been
      married to a count, handsome, noble, and rich; and the other,
      against her
      parents' wish, to a poor workingman who had taken her to a distant
      country, where she died of regret and misery. Alix and I listened
      attentively; but before Suzanne had finished, Alix softly took the
      book
      from her hands and replaced it on the shelf.</p>
    <p>"I would not have chosen that book for you; it is full of
      exaggerations
      and falsehoods."</p>
    <p>"And yet," said Suzanne, "see with what truth the lot of the
      countess is
      described! How happy she was in her emblazoned coach, and her
      jewels, her
      laces, her dresses of velvet and brocade! Ah, Fran&ccedil;oise! of
      the two
      destinies I choose that one."</p>
    <p>Alix looked at her for a moment and then dropped her head in
      silence.
      Suzanne went on in her giddy way:</p>
    <p>"And the other: how she was punished for her plebeian tastes!"</p>
    <p>"So, my dear Suzanne," responded Alix, "you would not marry&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"A man not my equal&#8212;a workman? Ah! certainly not."</p>
    <p>Madame Carpentier turned slightly pale. I looked at Suzanne with
      eyes full
      of reproach; and Suzanne remembering the gardener, at that moment
      in his
      shirt sleeves pushing one of the boat's long sweeps, bit her lip
      and
      turned to hide her tears. But Alix&#8212;the dear little creature!&#8212;rose,
      threw
      her arms about my sister's neck, kissed her, and said:</p>
    <p>"I know very well that you had no wish to give me pain, dear
      Suzanne. You
      have only called up some dreadful things that I am trying to
      forget. I am
      the daughter of a count. My childhood and youth were passed in
      ch&acirc;teaux
      and palaces, surrounded by every pleasure that an immense fortune
      could
      supply. As the wife of a viscount I have been received at court; I
      have
      been the companion of princesses. To-day all that is a dreadful
      dream.
      Before me I have a future the most modest and humble. I am the
      wife of
      Joseph the gardener; but poor and humble as is my present lot, I
      would not
      exchange it for the brilliant past, hidden from me by a veil of
      blood and
      tears. Some day I will write and send you my history; for I want
      to make
      it plain to you, Suzanne, that titles and riches do not make
      happiness,
      but that the poorest fate illumined by the fires of love is very
      often
      radiant with pleasure."</p>
    <p>We remained mute. I took Alix's hand in mine and silently pressed
      it. Even
      Suzanne, the inquisitive Suzanne, spoke not a word. She was
      content to
      kiss Alix and wipe away her tears.</p>
    <p>If the day had its pleasures, it was in the evenings, when we
      were all
      reunited on deck, that the moments of gayety began. When we had
      brilliant
      moonlight the flatboat would continue its course to a late hour.
      Then, in
      those calm, cool moments, when the movement of our vessel was so
      slight
      that it seemed to slide on the water, amid the odorous breezes of
      evening,
      the instruments of music were brought upon deck and our concerts
      began. My
      father played the flute delightfully; Carlo, by ear, played the
      violin
      pleasantly; and there, on the deck of that old flatboat, before an
      indulgent audience, our improvised instruments waked the sleeping
      creatures of the centuries-old forest and called around us the
      wondering
      fishes and alligators. My father and Alix played admirable duos on
      flute
      and harp, and sometimes Carlo added the notes of his violin or
      played for
      us cotillons and Spanish dances. Finally Suzanne and I, to please
      papa,
      sang together Spanish songs, or songs of the negroes, that made
      our
      auditors nearly die a-laughing; or French ballads, in which Alix
      would
      mingle her sweet voice. Then Carlo, with gestures that always
      frightened
      Patrick, made the air resound with Italian refrains, to which
      almost
      always succeeded the Irish ballads of the Gordons.</p>
    <p>But when it happened that the flatboat made an early stop to let
      our men
      rest, the programme was changed. Celeste and Maggie went ashore to
      cook
      the two suppers there. Their children gathered wood and lighted
      the
      fires. Mario and Gordon, or Gordon and 'Tino, went into the forest
      with
      their guns. Sometimes my father went along, or sat down by M.
      Carpentier,
      who was the fisherman. Alix, too, generally sat near her husband,
      her
      sketch-book on her knee, and copied the surrounding scene. Often,
      tired of
      fishing, we gathered flowers and wild fruits. I generally staid
      near Alix
      and her husband, letting Suzanne run ahead with Patrick and Tom.
      It was a
      strange thing, the friendship between my sister and this little
      Irish boy.
      Never during the journey did he address one word to me; he never
      answered
      a question from Alix; he ran away if my father or Joseph spoke to
      him; he
      turned pale and hid if Mario looked at him. But with Suzanne he
      talked,
      laughed, obeyed her every word, called her Miss Souzie, and was
      never so
      happy as when serving her. And when, twenty years afterward, she
      made a
      journey to Attakapas, the wealthy M. Patrick Gordon, hearing by
      chance of
      her presence, came with his daughter to make her his guest for a
      week,
      still calling her Miss Souzie, as of old.</p>

    <h2>VII.</h2>
    <h3>ODD PARTNERS IN THE BOLERO DANCE.</h3>
    <p>Only one thing we lacked&#8212;mass and Sunday prayers. But on that day
      the
      flatboat remained moored, we put on our Sunday clothes, gathered
      on deck,
      and papa read the mass aloud surrounded by our whole party,
      kneeling; and
      in the parts where the choir is heard in church, Alix, my sister,
      and I,
      seconded by papa and Mario, sang hymns.</p>
    <p>One evening&#8212;we had already been five weeks on our journey&#8212;the
      flatboat
      was floating slowly along, as if it were tired of going, between
      the
      narrow banks of a bayou marked in red ink on Carlo's map, "Bayou
      Sorrel."
      It was about six in the afternoon. There had been a suffocating
      heat all
      day. It was with joy that we came up on deck. My father, as he
      made his
      appearance, showed us his flute. It was a signal: Carlo ran for
      his
      violin, Suzanne for Alix's guitar, and presently Carpentier
      appeared with
      his wife's harp. Ah! I see them still: Gordon and 'Tino seated on
      a mat;
      Celeste and her children; Mario with his violin; Maggie; Patrick
      at the
      feet of Suzanne; Alix seated and tuning her harp; papa at her
      side; and M.
      Carpentier and I seated on the bench nearest the musicians.</p>
    <p>My father and Alix had already played some pieces, when papa
      stopped and
      asked her to accompany him in a new bolero which was then the
      vogue in New
      Orleans. In those days, at all the balls and parties, the boleros,
      fandangos, and other Spanish dances had their place with the
      French
      contra-dances and waltzes. Suzanne had made her entrance into
      society
      three years before, and danced ravishingly. Not so with me. I had
      attended
      my first ball only a few months before, and had taken nearly all
      my
      dancing-lessons from Suzanne. What was to become of me, then, when
      I heard
      my father ask me to dance the bolero which he and Alix were
      playing!...
      Every one made room for us, crying, "<i>Oh, oui, Mlle. Suzanne;
        dancez! Oh,
        dancez, Mlle. Fran&ccedil;oise!</i>" I did not wish to disobey
      my father. I did not
      want to disoblige my friends. Suzanne loosed her red scarf and
      tossed one
      end to me. I caught the end of the shawl that Suzanne was already
      waving
      over her head and began the first steps, but it took me only an
      instant to
      see that the task was beyond my powers. I grew confused, my head
      swam, and
      I stopped. But Alix did not stop playing; and Suzanne, wrapped in
      her
      shawl and turning upon herself, cried, "Play on!"</p>
    <p>I understood her intention in an instant.</p>
    <p>Harp and flute sounded on, and Suzanne, ever gliding, waltzing,
      leaping,
      her arms gracefully lifted above her head, softly waved her scarf,
      giving
      it a thousand different forms. Thus she made, twice, the circuit
      of the
      deck, and at length paused before Mario Carlo. But only for a
      moment. With
      a movement as quick as unexpected, she threw the end of her scarf
      to him.
      It wound about his neck. The Italian with a shoulder movement
      loosed the
      scarf, caught it in his left hand, threw his violin to Celeste,
      and bowed
      low to his challenger. All this as the etiquette of the bolero
      inexorably
      demanded. Then Maestro Mario smote the deck sharply with his
      heels, let go
      a cry like an Indian's war-whoop, and made two leaps into the air,
      smiting
      his heels against each other. He came down on the points of his
      toes,
      waving the scarf from his left hand; and twining his right arm
      about my
      sister's waist, he swept her away with him. They danced for at
      least half
      an hour, running the one after the other, waltzing, tripping,
      turning,
      leaping. The children and Gordon shouted with delight, while my
      father, M.
      Carpentier, and even Alix clapped their hands, crying, "Hurrah!"</p>
    <p>Suzanne's want of dignity exasperated me; but when I tried to
      speak of it,
      papa and Alix were against me.</p>
    <p>"On board a flatboat," said my father, "a breach of form is
      permissible."
      He resumed his flute with the first measures of a minuet.</p>
    <p>"Ah, our turn!" cried Alix; "our turn, Fran&ccedil;oise! I will
      be the cavalier!"</p>
    <p>I could dance the minuet as well as I could the bolero&#8212;that is,
      not at
      all; but Alix promised to guide me: and as, after all, I loved the
      dance
      as we love it at sixteen, I was easily persuaded, and fan in hand
      followed
      Alix, who for the emergency wore her husband's hat; and our minuet
      was
      received with as much enthusiasm as Suzanne's bolero. This ball
      was
      followed by others, and Alix gave me many lessons in the dance,
      that some
      weeks later were very valuable in the wilderness towards which we
      were
      journeying.</p>

    <h2>VIII.</h2>
    <h3>A BAD STORM IN A BAD PLACE.</h3>
    <p>The flatboat continued its course, and some slight signs of
      civilization
      began to appear at long intervals. Towards the end of a beautiful
      day in
      June, six weeks after our departure from New Orleans, the flatboat
      stopped
      at the pass of Lake Chicot.<a name="FNanchor13"></a><a
        href="#Footnote13">[13]</a> The sun was setting in a belt of
      gray
      clouds. Our men fastened their vessel securely and then cast their
      eyes
      about them.</p>
    <p>"Ah!" cried Mario, "I do not like this place; it is inhabited."
      He pointed
      to a wretched hut half hidden by the forest. Except two or three
      little
      cabins seen in the distance, this was the first habitation that
      had met
      our eyes since leaving the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor14"></a><a
        href="#Footnote14">[14]</a></p>
    <p>A woman showed herself at the door. She was scarcely dressed at
      all. Her
      feet were naked, and her tousled hair escaped from a wretched
      handkerchief
      that she had thrown upon her head. Hidden in the bushes and behind
      the
      trees half a dozen half-nude children gazed at us, ready to fly at
      the
      slightest sound. Suddenly two men with guns came out of the woods,
      but at
      the sight of the flatboat stood petrified. Mario shook his head.</p>
    <p>"If it were not so late I would take the boat farther on."</p>
    <p>[Yet he went hunting with 'Tino and Gordon along the shore,
      leaving the
      father of Fran&ccedil;oise and Suzanne lying on the deck with sick
      headache,
      Joseph fishing in the flatboat's little skiff, and the women and
      children
      on the bank, gazed at from a little distance by the sitting
      figures of the
      two strange men and the woman. Then the hunters returned, supper
      was
      prepared, and both messes ate on shore. Gordon and Mario joining
      freely in
      the conversation of the more cultivated group, and making
      altogether a
      strange Babel of English, French, Spanish, and Italian.]</p>
    <p>After supper Joseph and Alix, followed by my sister and me,
      plunged into
      the denser part of the woods.</p>
    <p>"Take care, comrade," we heard Mario say; "don't go far."</p>
    <p>The last rays of the sun were in the treetops. There were flowers
      everywhere. Alix ran here and there, all enthusiasm. Presently
      Suzanne
      uttered a cry and recoiled with affright from a thicket of
      blackberries.
      In an instant Joseph was at her side; but she laughed aloud,
      returned to
      the assault, and drew by force from the bushes a little girl of
      three or
      four years. The child fought and cried; but Suzanne held on, drew
      her to
      the trunk of a tree, sat down, and held her on her lap by force.
      The poor
      little thing was horribly dirty, but under its rags there were
      pretty
      features and a sweetness that inspired pity. Alix sat down by my
      sister
      and stroked the child's hair, and, like Suzanne, spite of the
      dirt, kissed
      her several times; but the little creature still fought, and
      yelled [in
      English]:</p>
    <p>"Let me alone! I want to go home! I want to go home!"</p>
    <p>Joseph advised my sister to let the child go, and Suzanne was
      about to do
      so when she remembered having at supper filled her pocket with
      pecans. She
      quickly filled the child's hands with them and the Rubicon was
      passed....
      She said that her name was Annie; that her father, mother, and
      brothers
      lived in the hut. That was all she could say. She did not know her
      parents' name. When Suzanne put her down she ran with all her legs
      towards
      the cabin to show Alix's gift, her pretty ribbon.</p>
    <p>Before the sun went down the wind rose. Great clouds covered the
      horizon;
      large rain-drops began to fall. Joseph covered the head of his
      young wife
      with her mantle, and we hastened back to the camp.</p>
    <p>"Do you fear a storm, Joseph?" asked Alix.</p>
    <p>"I do not know too much," he replied; "but when you are near, all
      dangers
      seem great."</p>
    <p>We found the camp deserted; all our companions were on board the
      flatboat.
      The wind rose to fury, and now the rain fell in torrents. We
      descended to
      our rooms. Papa was asleep. We did not disturb him, though we were
      greatly
      frightened.... Joseph and Gordon went below to sleep. Mario and
      his son
      loosed the three bull-dogs, but first removed the planks that
      joined the
      boat to the shore. Then he hoisted a great lantern upon a mast in
      the bow,
      lighted his pipe, and sat down to keep his son awake with stories
      of
      voyages and hunts.</p>
    <p>The storm seemed to increase in violence every minute. The rain
      redoubled
      its fury. Frightful thunders echoed each other's roars. The
      flatboat,
      tossed by the wind and waves, seemed to writhe in agony, while now
      and
      then the trunks of uprooted trees, lifted by the waves, smote it
      as they
      passed. Without a thought of the people in the hut, I made every
      effort to
      keep awake in the face of these menaces of Nature. Suzanne held my
      hand
      tightly in hers, and several times spoke to me in a low voice,
      fearing to
      wake papa, whom we could hear breathing regularly, sleeping
      without a
      suspicion of the surrounding dangers. Yet an hour had not passed
      ere I was
      sleeping profoundly. A knock on the partition awoke us and made us
      run to
      the door. Mario was waiting there.</p>
    <p>"Quick, monsieur! Get the young ladies ready. The flatboat has
      probably
      but ten minutes to live. We must take the women and children
      ashore. And
      please, signorina,"&#8212;to my sister,&#8212;"call M. and Mme. Carpentier."
      But
      Joseph had heard all, and showed himself at the door of our room.</p>
    <p>"Ashore? At such a time?"</p>
    <p>"We have no choice. We must go or perish."</p>
    <p>"But where?"</p>
    <p>"To the hut. We have no time to talk. My family is ready"....</p>
    <p>It took but a few minutes to obey papa's orders. We were already
      nearly
      dressed; and as sabots were worn at that time to protect the shoes
      from
      the mud and wet, we had them on in a moment. A thick shawl and a
      woolen
      hood completed our outfits. Alix was ready in a few moments.</p>
    <p>"Save your jewels,&#8212;those you prize most,&#8212;my love," cried
      Carpentier,
      "while I dress."</p>
    <p>Alix ran to her dressing-case, threw its combs, brushes, etc.,
      pell-mell
      into the bureau, opened a lower part of the case and took out four
      or five
      jewel-boxes that glided into her pockets, and two lockets that she
      hid
      carefully in her corsage. Joseph always kept their little fortune
      in a
      leathern belt beneath his shirt. He put on his vest and over it a
      sort of
      great-coat, slung his gun by its shoulder-belt, secured his
      pistols, and
      then taking from one of his trunks a large woolen cloak he wrapped
      Alix in
      it, and lifted her like a child of eight, while she crossed her
      little
      arms about his neck and rested her head on his bosom. Then he
      followed us
      into Mario's room, where his two associates were waiting. At
      another time
      we might have laughed at Maggie, but not now. She had slipped into
      her
      belt two horse-pistols. In one hand she held in leash her bull-dog
      Tom,
      and in the other a short carbine, her own property.</p>

    <h3>MAGGIE AND THE ROBBERS</h3>
    <p>"We are going out of here together," said Mario; "but John and I
      will
      conduct you only to the door of the hut. Thence we shall return to
      the
      flatboat, and all that two men can do to save our fortune shall be
      done.
      You, monsieur, have enough to do to take care of your daughters.
      To you,
      M. Carpentier&#8212;to you, son Celestino, I give the care of these
      women and
      children."</p>
    <p>"I can take care of myself," said Maggie.</p>
    <p>"You are four, well armed," continued Mario. (My father had his
      gun and
      pistols.) "This dog is worth two men. You have no risks to run;
      the
      danger, if there be any, will be with the boat. Seeing us divided,
      they
      may venture an attack; but one of you stand by the window that
      faces the
      shore. If one of those men in the hut leaves it, or shows a wish
      to do so,
      fire one pistol-shot out of the window, and we shall be ready for
      them;
      but if you are attacked, fire two shots and we will come. Now,
      forward!"</p>
    <p>We went slowly and cautiously: 'Tino first, with a lantern; then
      the Irish
      pair and child; then Mario, leading his two younger boys, and
      Celeste,
      with her daughter asleep in her arms; and for rear-guard papa with
      one of
      us on each arm, and Joseph with his precious burden. The wind and
      the
      irregularities of the ground made us stumble at every step. The
      rain
      lashed us in the face and extorted from time to time sad
      lamentations from
      the children. But, for all that, we were in a few minutes at the
      door of
      the hovel.</p>
    <p>"M. Carpentier," said Mario, "I give my family into your care."
      Joseph
      made no answer but to give his hand to the Italian. Mario strode
      away,
      followed by Gordon.</p>
    <p>"Knock on the door," said Joseph to 'Tino. The boy knocked. No
      sound was
      heard inside, except the growl of a dog.</p>
    <p>"Knock again." The same silence. "We can't stay here in this
      beating
      rain; open and enter," cried Carpentier. 'Tino threw wide the door
      and we
      walked in.</p>
    <p>There was but one room. A large fire burned in a clay chimney
      that almost
      filled one side of the cabin. In one corner four or five chickens
      showed
      their heads. In another, the woman was lying on a wretched pallet
      in all
      her clothes. By her slept the little creature Suzanne had found,
      her
      ribbon still on her frock. Near one wall was a big chest on which
      another
      child was sleeping. A rough table was in the middle, on it some
      dirty tin
      plates and cups, and under it half a dozen dogs and two little
      boys. I
      never saw anything else like it. On the hearth stood the pot and
      skillet,
      still half full of hominy and meat.</p>
    <p>Kneeling by the fire was a young man molding bullets and passing
      them to
      his father, seated on a stool at a corner of the chimney, who
      threw them
      into a jar of water, taking them out again to even them with the
      handle of
      a knife. I see it still as if it was before my eyes.</p>
    <p>The woman opened her eyes, but did not stir. The dogs rose
      tumultuously,
      but Tom showed his teeth and growled, and they went back under the
      table.
      The young man rose upon one knee, he and his father gazing
      stupidly at us,
      the firelight in their faces. We women shrank against our
      protectors,
      except Maggie, who let go a strong oath. The younger man was
      frightfully
      ugly; pale-faced, large-eyed, haggard, his long, tangled, blonde
      hair on
      his shoulders. The father's face was written all over with
      depravity and
      crime. Joseph advanced and spoke to him.</p>
    <p>"What the devil of a language is that?" he asked of his son in
      English.</p>
    <p>"He is asking you," said Maggie, "to let us stay here till the
      storm is
      over."</p>
    <p>"And where do you come from this way?"</p>
    <p>"From that flatboat tied to the bank."</p>
    <p>"Well, the house isn't big nor pretty, but you are its masters."</p>
    <p>Maggie went and sat by the window, ready to give the signal. Pat
      sank at
      her feet, and laying his head upon Tom went straight to sleep.
      Papa sat
      down by the fire on an inverted box and took me on one knee. With
      her head
      against his other, Suzanne crouched upon the floor. We were
      silent, our
      hearts beating hard, wishing ourselves with mamma in St. James.
      Joseph set
      Alix upon a stool beside him and removed her wrapping.</p>
    <p>"Hello!" said the younger stranger, "I thought you were carrying
      a child.
      It's a woman!"</p>
    <p>An hour passed. The woman in the corner seemed to sleep; Celeste,
      too,
      slumbered. When I asked Suzanne, softly, if she was asleep, she
      would
      silently shake her head. The men went on with their task, not
      speaking. At
      last they finished, divided the balls between them, put them into
      a
      leather pouch at their belt, and the father, rising, said:</p>
    <p>"Let us go. It is time."</p>
    <p>Maggie raised her head. The elder man went and got his gun and
      loaded it
      with two balls, and while the younger was muffling himself in an
      old
      blanket-overcoat such as we give to plantation negroes, moved
      towards the
      door and was about to pass out. But quicker than lightning Maggie
      had
      raised the window, snatched a pistol from her belt, and fired. The
      two men
      stood rooted, the elder frowning at Maggie. Tom rose and showed
      two rows
      of teeth.</p>
    <p>"What did you fire that pistol for? What signal are you giving?"</p>
    <p>"That is understood at the flatboat," said Maggie, tranquilly. "I
      was to
      fire if you left the house. You started, I fired, and that's all."</p>
    <p>"&#8212;&#8212;! And did you know, by yourself, what we were going to do?"</p>
    <p>"I haven't a doubt. You were simply going to attack and rob the
      flatboat."</p>
    <p>A second oath, fiercer than the first, escaped the man's lips.
      "You talk
      that way to me! Do you forget that you're in my power?"</p>
    <p>"Ah! Do you think so?" cried Maggie, resting her fists on her
      hips. "Ah,
      ha, ha!" That was the first time I ever heard her laugh&#8212;and such a
      laugh!
      "Don't you know, my dear sir, that at one turn of my hand this dog
      will
      strangle you like a chicken? Don't you see four of us here armed
      to the
      teeth, and at another signal our comrades yonder ready to join us
      in an
      instant? And besides, this minute they are rolling a little cannon
      up to
      the bow of the boat. Go, meddle with them, you'll see." She lied,
      but her
      lie averted the attack. She quietly sat down again and paid the
      scoundrel
      not the least attention.</p>
    <p>"And that's the way you pay us for taking you in, is it? Accuse a
      man of
      crime because he steps out of his own house to look at the
      weather? Well,
      that's all right." While the man spoke he put his gun into a
      corner,
      resumed his seat, and lighted a cob pipe. The son had leaned on
      his gun
      during the colloquy. Now he put it aside and lay down upon the
      floor to
      sleep. The awakened children slept. Maggie sat and smoked. My
      father,
      Joseph, and 'Tino talked in low tones. All at once the old ruffian
      took
      his pipe from his mouth and turned to my father.</p>
    <p>"Where do you come from?"</p>
    <p>"From New Orleans, sir."</p>
    <p>"How long have you been on the way?"</p>
    <p>"About a month."</p>
    <p>"And where are you going," etc. Joseph, like papa, remained
      awake, but
      like him, like all of us, longed with all his soul for the end of
      that
      night of horror.</p>
    <p>At the first crowing of the cock the denizens of the hut were
      astir. The
      father and son took their guns and went into the forest. The fire
      was
      relighted. The woman washed some hominy in a pail and seemed to
      have
      forgotten our presence; but the little girl recognized Alix, who
      took from
      her own neck a bright silk handkerchief and tied it over the
      child's head,
      put a dollar in her hand, and kissed her forehead. Then it was
      Suzanne's
      turn. She covered her with kisses. The little one laughed, and
      showed the
      turban and the silver that "the pretty lady," she said, had given
      her.
      Next, my sister dropped, one by one, upon the pallet ten dollars,
      amazing
      the child with these playthings; and then she took off her red
      belt and
      put it about her little pet's neck.</p>
    <p>My father handed me a handful of silver. "They are very poor, my
      daughter;
      pay them well for their hospitality." As I approached the woman I
      heard
      Joseph thank her and offer her money.</p>
    <p>"What do you want me to do with that?" she said, pushing my hand
      away.
      "Instead of that, send me some coffee and tobacco."</p>
    <p>That ended it; I could not pay in money. But when I looked at the
      poor
      woman's dress so ragged and torn, I took off [J'autai] my shawl,
      which was
      large and warm, and put it on her shoulders,&#8212;I had another in the
      boat,&#8212;and she was well content. When I got back to the flatboat I
      sent
      her some chemises, petticoats, stockings, and a pair of shoes. The
      shoes
      were papa's. Alix also sent her three skirts and two chemises, and
      Suzanne
      two old dresses and two chemises for her children, cutting down
      what was
      too large. Before quitting the hut Celeste had taken from her two
      lads
      their knitted neckerchiefs and given them to the two smaller boys,
      and
      Maggie took the old shawl that covered Pat's shoulders and threw
      it upon
      the third child, who cried out with joy. At length we returned to
      our
      vessel, which had triumphantly fought the wind and floating trees.
      Mario
      took to the cabin our gifts, to which we added sugar, biscuits,
      and a sack
      of pecans.</p>

    <h3>ALIX PUTS AWAY THE PAST.</h3>
    <p>For two weeks more our boat continued its slow and silent voyage
      among the
      bayous. We saw signs of civilization, but they were still far
      apart. These
      signs alarmed Mario. He had already chosen his place of abode and
      spoke of
      it with his usual enthusiasm; a prairie where he had camped for
      two weeks
      with his young hunters five years before.</p>
    <p>"A principality&#8212;that is what I count on establishing there," he
      cried,
      pushing his hand through his hair. "And think!&#8212;if, maybe, some one
      has
      occupied it! Oh, the thief! the robber! Let him not fall into my
      hands!
      I'll strangle&#8212;I'll kill him!"</p>
    <p>My father, to console him, would say that it would be easy to
      find other
      tracts just as fine.</p>
    <p>"Never!" replied he, rolling his eyes and brandishing his arms;
      and his
      fury would grow until Maggie cried:</p>
    <p>"He is Satan himself! He's the devil!"</p>
    <p>One evening the flatboat stopped a few miles only from where is
      now the
      village of Pattersonville. The weather was magnificent, and while
      papa,
      Gordon, and Mario went hunting, Joseph, Alix, and we two walked on
      the
      bank. Little by little we wandered, and, burying ourselves in the
      interior, we found ourselves all at once confronting a little
      cottage
      embowered in a grove of oranges. Alix uttered a cry of admiration
      and
      went towards the house. We saw that it was uninhabited and must
      have been
      long abandoned. The little kitchen, the poultry-house, the
      dovecote, were
      in ruins. But the surroundings were admirable: in the rear a large
      court
      was entirely shaded with live-oaks; in front was the green belt of
      orange
      trees; farther away Bayou Teche, like a blue ribbon, marked a
      natural
      boundary, and at the bottom of the picture the great trees of the
      forest
      lifted their green-brown tops.</p>
    <p>"Oh!" cried Alix, "if I could stay here I should be happy."</p>
    <p>"Who knows?" replied Joseph. "The owner has left the house; he
      may be
      dead. Who knows but I may take this place?"</p>
    <p>"Oh! I pray you, Joseph, try. Try!" At that moment my father and
      Mario
      appeared, looking for us, and Alix cried:</p>
    <p>"Welcome, gentlemen, to my domain."</p>
    <p>Joseph told of his wife's wish and his hope.... "In any case,"
      said Mario,
      "count on us. If you decide to settle here we will stay two
      weeks&#8212;a
      month, if need be&#8212;to help you establish yourself."</p>
    <p>As soon as we had breakfasted my father and Joseph set out for a
      plantation which they saw in the distance. They found it a rich
      estate.
      The large, well-built house was surrounded by outbuildings,
      stables,
      granaries, and gardens; fields of cane and corn extended to the
      limit of
      view. The owner, M. Gerbeau, was a young Frenchman. He led them
      into the
      house, presented them to his wife, and offered them refreshments.</p>
    <p>[M. Gerbeau tells the travelers how he had come from the
      Mississippi
      River parish of St. Bernard to this place with all his effects in
      a
      schooner&#8212;doubtless via the mouth of the river and the bay of
      Atchafalaya;
      while Joseph is all impatience to hear of the little deserted home
      concerning which he has inquired. But finally he explains that its
      owner,
      a lone Swede, had died of sunstroke two years before, and M.
      Gerbeau's
      best efforts to find, through the Swedish consul at New Orleans or
      otherwise, a successor to the little estate had been unavailing.
      Joseph
      could take the place if he would. He ended by generously forcing
      upon the
      father of Fran&ccedil;oise and Suzanne the free use of his
      traveling-carriage and
      "two horses, as gentle as lambs and as swift as deer," with which
      to make
      their journey up the Teche to St. Martinville,<a name="FNanchor15"></a><a
        href="#Footnote15">[15]</a> the gay, not to say
      giddy, little capital of the royalist <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i>.]</p>
    <p>My father wished to know what means of transport he could secure,
      on his
      return to this point, to take us home.</p>
    <p>"Don't let that trouble you; I will arrange that. I already have
      a
      plan&#8212;you shall see."</p>
    <p>The same day the work began on the Carpentier's home. The three
      immigrants
      and 'Tino fell bravely to work, and M. Gerbeau brought his
      carpenter and a
      cart-load of lumber. Two new rooms were added. The kitchen was
      repaired,
      then the stable, the dovecote, the poultry-house; the garden
      fences were
      restored; also those of the field. My father gave Joseph one of
      his cows;
      the other was promised to Carlo. Mme. Gerbeau was with us much,
      helping
      Alix, as were we. We often dined with her. One Sunday M. Gerbeau
      came for
      us very early and insisted that Mario and Gordon should join us.
      Maggie,
      with her usual phlegm, had declined.</p>
    <p>At dinner our host turned the conversation upon St. Martinville,
      naming
      again all the barons, counts, and marquises of whom he had spoken
      to my
      father, and descanting especially on the grandeur of the balls and
      parties
      he had there attended.</p>
    <p>"And we have only our camayeu skirts!" cried Suzanne.</p>
    <p>"Daughter," observed papa, "be content with what you have. You
      are neither
      a duchess nor a countess, and besides you are traveling."</p>
    <p>"And," said M. Gerbeau, "the stores there are full of knickknacks
      that
      would capture the desires of a queen."</p>
    <p>On returning to our flatboat Alix came into my room, where I was
      alone,
      and laying her head on my shoulder:</p>
    <p>"Fran&ccedil;oise," she said, "I have heard mentioned today the
      dearest friend I
      ever had. That Countess de la Houssaye of whom M. Gerbeau spoke is
      Madelaine de Livilier, my companion in convent, almost my sister.
      We were
      married nearly at the same time; we were presented at court the
      same day;
      and now here we are, both, in Louisiana!"</p>
    <p>"O Alix!" I cried, "I shall see her. Papa has a letter to her
      husband; I
      shall tell her; she will come to see you; and&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"No, no! You must not speak of me, Fran&ccedil;oise. She knew and
      loved the
      Countess Alix de Morainville. I know her; she would repel with
      scorn the
      wife of the gardener. I am happy in my obscurity. Let nothing
      remind me of
      other days."</p>
    <p>Seeing that Alix said nothing of all this to Suzanne, I imitated
      her
      example. With all her goodness, Suzanne was so thoughtless and
      talkative!</p>

    <h3>ALIX PLAYS FAIRY.&#8212;PARTING TEARS.</h3>
    <p>In about fifteen days the work on the cottage was nearly done and
      the
      moving began, Celeste, and even Maggie, offering us their
      services. Alix
      seemed enchanted.</p>
    <p>"Two things, only, I lack," she said&#8212;"a sofa, and something to
      cover the
      walls."</p>
    <p>One morning M. Gerbeau sent to Carpentier a horse, two fine cows
      and their
      calves, and a number of sheep and pigs. At the same time two or
      three
      negresses, loaded down with chickens, geese, and ducks, made their
      appearance. Also M. Gerbeau.</p>
    <p>"What does all this mean?" asked Joseph.</p>
    <p>"This is the succession of the dead Swede," replied the generous
      young
      man.</p>
    <p>"But I have no right to his succession."</p>
    <p>"That's a question," responded M. Gerbeau. "You have inherited
      the house,
      you must inherit all. If claimants appear&#8212;well, you will be
      responsible
      to them. You will please give me a receipt in due form; that is
      all."</p>
    <p>Tears came into Carpentier's eyes.... As he was signing the
      receipt M.
      Gerbeau stopped him. "Wait; I forgot something. At the time of
      Karl's [the
      Swede's] death, I took from his crib fifty barrels of corn; add
      that."</p>
    <p>"O sir!" cried Joseph, "that is too much&#8212;too much."</p>
    <p>"Write!" said M. Gerbeau, laying his hand on Joseph's shoulder,
      "if you
      please. I am giving you nothing; I am relieving myself of a
      burden."</p>
    <hr style="width: 45%;">
    <p>My dear daughter, if I have talked very much about Alix it is
      because
      talking about her is such pleasure. She has been so good to my
      sister and
      me! The memory of her is one of the brightest of my youth.</p>
    <p>The flatboat was to go in three days. One morning, when we had
      passed the
      night with Mme. Gerbeau, Patrick came running to say that "Madame
      'Lix"
      wished to see us at once. We hastened to the cottage. Alix met us
      on the
      gallery [veranda].</p>
    <p>"Come in, dear girls. I have a surprise for you and a great favor
      to ask.
      I heard you say, Suzanne, you had nothing to wear&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"But our camayeu petticoats!"</p>
    <p>"But your camayeu petticoats." She smiled.</p>
    <p>"And they, it seems, do not tempt your vanity. You want better?"</p>
    <p>"Ah, indeed we do!" replied Suzanne.</p>
    <p>"Well, let us play Cinderella. The dresses of velvet, silk, and
      lace, the
      jewels, the slippers&#8212;all are in yonder chest. Listen, my dear
      girls. Upon
      the first signs of the Revolution my frightened mother left France
      and
      crossed into England. She took with her all her wardrobe, her
      jewels, the
      pictures from her bedroom, and part of her plate. She bought,
      before
      going, a quantity of silks and ribbons.... When I reached England
      my
      mother was dead, and all that she had possessed was restored to me
      by the
      authorities. My poor mother loved dress, and in that chest is all
      her
      apparel. Part of it I had altered for my own use; but she was much
      larger
      than I&#8212;taller than you. I can neither use them nor consent to sell
      them.
      If each of you will accept a ball toilet, you will make me very
      happy."
      And she looked at us with her eyes full of supplication, her hands
      clasped.</p>
    <p>We each snatched a hand and kissed it. Then she opened the chest,
      and for
      the first and last time in my life I saw fabrics, ornaments, and
      coiffures
      that truly seemed to have been made by the fairies. After many
      trials and
      much debate she laid aside for me a lovely dress of blue brocade
      glistening with large silver flowers the reflections of which
      seemed like
      rays of light. It was short in front, with a train; was very full
      on the
      sides, and was caught up with knots of ribbon. The long pointed
      waist was
      cut square and trimmed with magnificent laces that re-appeared on
      the
      half-long sleeves. The arms, to the elbow, were to be covered with
      white
      frosted gloves fastened with twelve silver buttons. To complete my
      toilet
      she gave me a blue silk fan beautifully painted, blue satin
      slippers with
      high heels and silver buckles, white silk stockings with blue
      clocks, a
      broidered white cambric handkerchief trimmed with Brussels point
      lace,
      and, last, a lovely set of silver filigree that she assured us was
      of
      slight value, comprising the necklace, the comb, the earrings,
      bracelets,
      and a belt whose silver tassels of the same design fell down the
      front of
      the dress.</p>
    <p>My sister's toilet was exactly like mine, save that it was rose
      color.
      Alix had us try them on. While our eyes were ravished, she, with
      more
      expert taste, decided to take up a little in one place, lower a
      ribbon in
      another, add something here, take away there, and, above all, to
      iron the
      whole with care. We staid all day helping her; and when, about 3
      o'clock,
      all was finished, our fairy godmother said she would now dress our
      hair,
      and that we must observe closely.</p>
    <p>"For Suzanne will have to coiffe Fran&ccedil;oise and
      Fran&ccedil;oise coiffe Suzanne,"
      she said. She took from the chest two pasteboard boxes that she
      said
      contained the headdresses belonging to our costumes, and, making
      me sit
      facing my sister, began to dress her hair. I was all eyes. I did
      not lose
      a movement of the comb. She lifted Suzanne's hair to the middle of
      the
      head in two rosettes that she called <i>riquettes</i> and
      fastened them with a
      silver comb. Next, she made in front, or rather on the forehead,
      with
      hairpins, numberless little knots, or whorls, and placed on each
      side of
      the head a plume of white, rose-tipped feathers, and in front,
      opposite
      the riquettes, placed a rose surrounded with silver leaves. Long
      rose-colored, silver-frosted ribbons falling far down on the back
      completed the headdress, on which Alix dusted handfuls of silver
      powder.
      Can you believe it, my daughter, that was the first time my sister
      and I
      had ever seen artificial flowers? They made very few of them, even
      in
      France, in those days.</p>
    <p>While Suzanne admired herself in the mirror I took her place. My
      headdress
      differed from hers in the ends of my feathers being blue, and in
      the rose
      being white, surrounded by pale blue violets and a few silver
      leaves. And
      now a temptation came to all of us. Alix spoke first:</p>
    <p>"Now put on your ball-dresses and I will send for our friends.
      What do you
      think?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, that would be charming!" cried Suzanne. "Let us hurry!" And
      while we
      dressed, Pat, always prowling about the cottage, was sent to the
      flatboat
      to get his parents and the Carlos, and to M. Gerbeau's to ask my
      father
      and M. and Mme. Gerbeau to come at once to the cottage.... No, I
      cannot
      tell the cries of joy that greeted us. The children did not know
      us, and
      Maggie had to tell Pat over and over that these were Miss Souzie
      and Miss
      Francise. My father's eyes filled with tears as he thanked Alix
      for her
      goodness and generosity to us.</p>
    <p>Alas! the happiest days, like the saddest, have an end. On the
      morrow the
      people in the flatboat came to say good-bye. Mario cried like a
      child.
      Celeste carried &Agrave;lix's hands to her lips and said in the
      midst of her
      tears:</p>
    <p>"O Madame! I had got so used to you&#8212;I hoped never to leave you."</p>
    <p>"I will come to see you, Celeste," replied Alix to the young
      mulattress,
      "I promise you."</p>
    <p>Maggie herself seemed moved, and in taking leave of Alix put two
      vigorous
      kisses on her cheeks. As to our father, and us, too, the adieus
      were not
      final, we having promised Mario and Gordon to stop [on their
      journey up
      the shore of the bayou] as soon as we saw the flatboat.</p>
    <p>"And we hope, my dear Carlo, to find you established in your
      principality."</p>
    <p>"Amen!" responded the Italian.</p>
    <p>Alix added to her gifts two pairs of chamois-skin gloves and a
      box of
      lovely artificial flowers. Two days after the flatboat had gone,
      we having
      spent the night with Alix, came M. Gerbeau's carriage to take us
      once more
      upon our journey. Ah! that was a terrible moment. Even Alix could
      scarce
      hold back the tears. We refused to get into the carriage, and
      walked, all
      of us together, to M. Gerbeau's, and then parted amid tears,
      kisses, and
      promises.</p>

    <h2>XII.</h2>
    <h3>LITTLE PARIS.</h3>
    <p>[So the carriage rolled along the margin of Bayou Teche, with two
      big
      trunks besides Monsieur's on back and top, and a smaller one, lent
      by
      Alix, lashed underneath; but shawls, mats, and baskets were all
      left
      behind with the Carpentiers. The first stop was at the plantation
      and
      residence of Captain Patterson, who "offered his hand in the
      English way,
      saying only, 'Welcomed, young ladies.'" In 1795, the narrator
      stops to
      say, one might see in and about New Orleans some two-story houses;
      but
      along the banks of Bayou Teche, as well as on the Mississippi,
      they were
      all of one sort,&#8212;like their own; like Captain Patterson's,&#8212;a
      single
      ground floor with three rooms facing front and three back. Yet the
      very
      next stop was at a little cottage covered with roses and with its
      front
      yard full of ducks and geese,&#8212;"'A genuine German cottage,' said
      papa,"&#8212;where a German girl, to call her father, put a great ox's
      horn to
      her lips and blew a loud blast. Almost every one was English or
      German
      till they came to where was just beginning to be the town of
      Franklin. One
      Harlman, a German, offered to exchange all his land for the silver
      watch
      that it best suited Monsieur to travel with. The exchange was
      made, the
      acts were all signed and sealed, and&#8212;when Suzanne, twenty years
      after,
      made a visit to Attakapas there was Harlman and his numerous
      family still
      in peaceful possession of the place.... "And I greatly fear that
      when some
      day our grandchildren awaken from that apathy with which I have
      always
      reproached the Creoles, I fear, my daughter, they will have
      trouble to
      prove their titles."</p>
    <p>But they journeyed on, Fran&ccedil;oise ever looking out the
      carriage window for
      the flatboat, and Suzanne crying:</p>
    <p>"Annie, my sister Annie, do you see nothing coming?" And about
      two miles
      from where Franklin was to be they came upon it, greeted with
      joyous
      laughter and cries of "Miss Souzie! O Miss Souzie!" from the women
      and the
      children, and from Mario: "I have it, Signor! I have it! My
      prinicipality,
      Miss Souzie! It is mine, Signorina Fran&ccedil;oise!" while he
      danced, laughed,
      and brandished his arms. "He had taken up enough land," says
      Fran&ccedil;oise,
      "for five principalities, and was already knocking the flatboat to
      pieces."</p>
    <p>She mentioned meeting Jacques and Charles Picot, St. Domingan
      refugees,
      whose story of adventures she says was very wonderful, but with
      good
      artistic judgement omits them. The travelers found, of course, a
      <i>charmante cordialit&eacute;</i> at the home of M. Agricole
      Fuselier<a name="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote16">[16]</a>,
      and saw a
      little girl of five who afterward became a great beauty&#8212;Uranie
      Fuselier.
      They passed another Indian village, where Fran&ccedil;oise
      persuaded them not to
      stop. Its inhabitants were Chetimachas, more civilized than those
      of the
      village near Plaquemine, and their sworn enemies, living in
      constant fear
      of an attack from them. At New Iberia, a town founded by
      Spaniards, the
      voyagers saw "several houses, some drinking-shops and other
      buildings,"
      and spent with "the pretty little Madame Dubuclet ... two of the
      pleasantest days of their lives."]</p>
    <p>At length, one beautiful evening in July, under a sky resplendent
      with
      stars, amid the perfume of gardens and caressed by the cool night
      breeze,
      we made our entry into the village of St. Martinville&#8212;the Little
      Paris,
      the oasis in the desert.</p>
    <p>My father ordered Julien [the coachman] to stop at the best inn.
      He turned
      two or three corners and stopped near the bayou [Teche] just
      beside the
      bridge, before a house of the strangest aspect possible. There
      seemed
      first to have been built a <i>rez-de-chauss&eacute;e</i> house of
      ordinary size, to
      which had been hastily added here a room, there a cabinet, a
      balcony,
      until the "White Pelican"&#8212;I seem to see it now&#8212;was like a house of
      cards, likely to tumble before the first breath of wind. The
      host's name
      was Morphy. He came forward, hat in hand, a pure-blooded American,
      but
      speaking French almost like a Frenchman. In the house all was
      comfortable
      and shining with cleanness. Madame Morphy took us to our room,
      adjoining
      papa's ["tou ta c&ocirc;t&eacute; de selle de papa"], the two
      looking out, across the
      veranda, upon the waters of the Teche.</p>
    <p>After supper my father proposed a walk. Madame Morphy showed us,
      by its
      lights, in the distance, a theater!</p>
    <p>"They are playing, this evening, 'The Barber of Seville.'"</p>
    <p>We started on our walk, moving slowly, scanning the houses and
      listening
      to the strains of music that reached us from the distance. It
      seemed but a
      dream that at any moment might vanish. On our return to the inn,
      papa
      threw his letters upon the table and began to examine their
      addresses.</p>
    <p>"To whom will you carry the first letter, papa?" I asked.</p>
    <p>"To the Baron du Clozel," he replied. "I have already met him in
      New
      Orleans, and even had the pleasure to render him a slight
      service."</p>
    <p>Mechanically Suzanne and I examined the addresses and amused
      ourselves
      reading the pompous title's.</p>
    <p>"'Le chevalier Louis de Blanc!'" began my sister; "'L'honorable
      A.
      D&eacute;clouet'; 'Le comte Louis le Pelletrier de la Houssaye'!
      Ah!" she cried,
      throwing the packet upon the table, "the aristocrats! I am
      frightened,
      poor little plebeian that I am."</p>
    <p>"Yes, my daughter," responded my father, "these names represent
      true
      aristocrats, as noble in virtues as in blood. My father has often
      told me
      of two uncles of the Count de la Houssaye: the first, Claude de la
      Pelletrier de la Houssaye, was prime minister to King Louis XV.;
      and the
      second, Barthelemy, was employed by the Minister of Finance. The
      count, he
      to whom I bear this letter, married Madelaine Victoire de
      Livilier. These
      are noble names."</p>
    <p>Then Alix was not mistaken; it was really her friend, the
      Countess
      Madelaine, whom I was about to meet.</p>

    <h2>XIII.</h2>
    <h3>THE COUNTESS MADELAINE.</h3>
    <p>Early the next day I saw, through the partly open door, my father
      finishing his toilet.</p>
    <p>He had already fastened over his black satin breeches his garters
      secured
      with large buckles of chased silver. Similar buckles were on his
      shoes.
      His silver-buttoned vest of white piqu&eacute; reached low down,
      and his black
      satin coat faced with white silk had large lappets cut square.
      Such dress
      seemed to me very warm for summer; but the fashion and etiquette
      allowed
      only silk and velvet for visits of ceremony, and though you
      smothered you
      had to obey those tyrants. At the moment when I saw him out of the
      corner
      of my eye he was sticking a cluster diamond pin into his
      shirt-frill and
      another diamond into his lace cravat. It was the first time I ever
      saw
      papa so fine, so dressed! Presently we heard him call us to
      arrange his
      queue, and although it was impossible for us to work up a club and
      pigeon
      wings like those I saw on the two young Du Clozels and on M.
      Neville
      D&eacute;clouet, we arranged a very fine queue wrapped with a
      black ribbon, and
      after smiling at himself in the glass and declaring that he
      thought the
      whole dress was in very good taste he kissed us, took his
      three-cornered
      hat and his gold-headed cane and went out. With what impatience we
      awaited
      his return!</p>
    <p>About two hours afterward we saw papa coming back accompanied by
      a
      gentleman of a certain age, handsome, noble, elegant in his severe
      suit of
      black velvet. He had the finest black eyes in the world, and his
      face
      beamed with wit and amiability. You have guessed it was the Baron
      du
      Clozel. The baron bowed to us profoundly. He certainly knew who we
      were,
      but etiquette required him to wait until my father had presented
      us; but
      immediately then he asked papa's permission to kiss us, and you
      may
      suppose your grandfather did not refuse.</p>
    <p>M. du Clozel had been sent by the baroness to oppose our sojourn
      at the
      inn, and to bring us back with him.</p>
    <p>"Run, put on your hoods," said papa; "we will wait for you here."</p>
    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Morphy were greatly disappointed to see us go, and
      the former
      declared that if these nobles kept on taking away their custom
      they would
      have to shut up shop. Papa, to appease him, paid him double what
      he asked.
      And the baron gave his arm to Suzanne, as the elder, while I
      followed, on
      papa's. Madame du Clozel and her daughter met us at the street
      gate. The
      baroness, though not young, was still pretty, and so elegant, so
      majestic!
      A few days later I could add, so good, so lovable!</p>
    <p>Celeste du Clozel was eighteen. Her hair was black as ebony, and
      her eyes
      a beautiful blue. The young men of the village called her <i>Celeste
        la bien
        nomm&eacute;e</i> [Celeste the well named]; and for all her
      beauty, fortune, and
      high position she was good and simple and always ready to oblige.
      She was
      engaged, we learned afterward, to the Chevalier de Blanc, the same
      who in
      1803 was made post-commandant of Attakapas.<a name="FNanchor17"></a><a
        href="#Footnote17">[17]</a> Olivier and Charles du
      Clozel turned everything to our entertainment, and it was soon
      decided
      that we should all go that same evening to the theater.</p>
    <p>Hardly was the sun down when we shut ourselves into our rooms to
      begin the
      work of dressing. Celeste put herself at our service, assuring us
      that she
      knew perfectly how to dress hair. The baroness asked us to let her
      lend us
      ornaments, ribbons&#8212;whatever we might need. We could see that she
      supposed
      two young girls who had never seen the great world, who came from
      a region
      where nearly all articles of luxury were wanting, could hardly
      have a
      choice wardrobe. We thanked them, assuring Celeste that we had
      always
      cultivated the habit of dressing each other's hair.</p>
    <p>We put on our camayeu petticoats and our black velvet waists,
      adding
      gloves; and in our hair, sparkling with gold powder, we put, each
      of us, a
      bunch of the roses given us by Alix. We found ourselves charming,
      and
      hoped to create a sensation. But if the baroness was satisfied she
      showed
      no astonishment. Her hair, like her daughter's, was powdered, and
      both
      wore gloves.</p>
    <p>Suzanne on the arm of Olivier, I on Charles's, Celeste beside her
      fianc&eacute;,
      the grandparents in front, we entered the theater of St.
      Martinville, and
      in a moment more were the observed of all observers. The play was
      a
      vaudeville, of which I remember only the name, but rarely have I
      seen
      amateurs act so well: all the prominent parts were rendered by
      young men.
      But if the French people are polite, amiable, and hospitable, we
      know that
      they are also very inquisitive. Suzanne was more annoyed than I
      can tell;
      yet we knew that our toilets were in excellent taste, even in that
      place
      full of ladies covered with costly jewels. When I asked Celeste
      how the
      merchants of St. Martinville could procure these costly goods, she
      explained that near by there was a place named the <i>Butte
        &agrave; la Rose</i> that
      greatly shortened the way to market.<a name="FNanchor18"></a><a
        href="#Footnote18">[18]</a> They were bringing almost
      everything from London, owing to the Revolution. Between the acts
      many
      persons came to greet Madame du Clozel. Oh, how I longed to see
      the friend
      of Alix! But I would not ask anything; I resolved to find her by
      the aid
      of my heart alone.</p>
    <p>Presently, as by a magnetic power, my attention was drawn to a
      tall and
      beautiful young lady dressed in white satin, with no ornaments
      except a
      set of gold and sapphires, and for headdress a <i>r&eacute;sille</i>
      the golden
      tassels of which touched her neck. Ah! how quickly I recognized
      those
      brown eyes faintly proud, that kind smile, that queenly bearing,
      that
      graceful step! I turned to Charles du Clozel, who sat beside me,
      and said:</p>
    <p>"That is the Countess de la Houssaye, isn't it?"</p>
    <p>"Do you know her?"</p>
    <p>"I see her for the first time; but&#8212;I guessed it."</p>
    <p>Several times I saw her looking at me, and once she smiled.
      During the
      last two acts she came and shook hands with us, and, caressing our
      hair
      with her gloved hand, said her husband had seen papa's letter;
      that it was
      from a dear friend, and that she came to ask Madame du Clozel to
      let her
      take us away with her. Against this the baroness cried out, and
      then the
      Countess Madelaine said to us:</p>
    <p>"Well, you will come spend the day with me day after to-morrow,
      will you?
      I shall invite only young people. May I come for you?"</p>
    <p>Ah, that day! how I remember it!... Madame de la Houssaye was
      fully five
      or six years older than Madame Carpentier, for she was the mother
      of four
      boys, the eldest of whom was fully twelve.<a name="FNanchor19"></a><a
        href="#Footnote19">[19]</a> Her house was, like Madame
      du Clozel's, a single rez-de-chauss&eacute;e surmounted by a
      mansard.... From
      the drawing-room she conducted us to a room in the rear of the
      house at
      the end of the veranda [galerie], where ... a low window let into
      a garden
      crossed and re-crossed with alleys of orange and jasmine. Several
      lofty
      magnolias filled the air with the fragrance of their great white
      flowers....</p>

    <h2>XIV.</h2>
    <h3>"POOR LITTLE ALIX!"</h3>
    <p>Hardly had we made a few steps into the room when a young girl
      rose and
      advanced, supported on the arm of a young man slightly
      overdressed. His
      club and pigeon-wings were fastened with three or four pins of
      gold, and
      his white-powdered queue was wrapped with a black velvet ribbon
      shot with
      silver. The heat was so great that he had substituted silk for
      velvet, and
      his dress-coat, breeches, and long vest were of pearl-gray silk,
      changing
      to silver, with large silver buttons. On the lace frill of his
      embroidered
      shirt shone three large diamonds, on his cravat was another, and
      his
      fingers were covered with rings.<a name="FNanchor20"></a><a
        href="#Footnote20">[20]</a> The young girl embraced us with
      ceremony, while her companion bowed profoundly. She could hardly
      have
      been over sixteen or seventeen. One could easily guess by her
      dress that
      the pretty creature was the slave of fashion.</p>
    <p>"Madame du Rocher," said Charles du Clozel, throwing a wicked
      glance upon
      her.</p>
    <p>"Madame!" I stammered.</p>
    <p>"Impossible!" cried Suzanne.</p>
    <p>"Don't listen to him!" interrupted the young lady, striking
      Charles's
      fingers with her fan. "He is a wretched falsifier. I am called
      Tonton de
      Blanc."</p>
    <p>"The widow du Rocher!" cried Olivier, from the other side.</p>
    <p>"Ah, this is too much!" she exclaimed. "If you don't stop these
      ridiculous
      jokes at once I'll make Neville call you out upon the field of
      battle."
      ... But a little while afterward Celeste whispered in my ear that
      her
      brothers had said truly. At thirteen years Tonton, eldest daughter
      of
      Commandant Louis de Blanc and sister of Chevalier de Blanc, had
      been
      espoused to Dr. du Rocher, at least forty years older than she. He
      was
      rich, and two years later he died, leaving all his fortune to his
      widow.... One after another Madame de la Houssaye introduced to us
      at
      least twenty persons, the most of whose names, unfortunately, I
      have
      forgotten. I kept notes, but have mislaid them....</p>
    <p>A few moments before dinner the countess re-appeared among us,
      followed by
      two servants in livery bearing salvers of fruit; and while we ate
      she
      seated herself at the harpsichord and played.</p>
    <p>"Do you sing?" she asked me.</p>
    <p>"A little, madame."</p>
    <p>[The two sisters sang a song together.]</p>
    <p>"Children," she cried, "tell me, I pray you, who taught you that
      duet?"</p>
    <p>"A young French lady, one of our friends," replied Suzanne.</p>
    <p>"But her name! What is her name?"</p>
    <p>"Madame Carpentier."</p>
    <p>The name meant nothing to her. She sighed, and asked us to sing
      on.... At
      dinner we met again my father and the count. After dinner the
      countess
      sent for me to come to her chamber while she was nursing her babe.
      After a
      few unimportant words she said:</p>
    <p>"You have had your lessons from a good musician."</p>
    <p>"Yes, madame, our friend plays beautifully on the harp."</p>
    <p>"On the harp! And you say her name is&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"Madame Joseph Carpentier."</p>
    <p>"It is strange," said Madame de la Houssaye. "The words of your
      duet are
      by me, and the music by my friend the Viscomptesse Alix de
      Morainville.
      All manner of things have happened in this terrible Revolution; I
      had for
      a moment the hope that she had found chance to emigrate and that
      you had
      met her. Do you know M. Carpentier?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, madame; he was with her. He is&#8212;in fact&#8212;a laboring
      gardener."</p>
    <p>"Oh! then there is no hope. I had the thought of a second
      marriage, but
      Alix de Morainville could never stoop so low. Poor, dear, innocent
      little
      Alix! She must be dead&#8212;at the hand of butchers, as her father and
      her
      husband are."</p>
    <p>When we returned to the joyous company in the garden all wanted
      to speak
      at once. The countess imposed silence, and then Tonton informed us
      that a
      grand ball was proposed in our honor, to be given in the large
      dining-room
      of Mr. Morphy's tavern, under the direction of Neville
      D&eacute;clouet, the
      following Monday&#8212;that is, in four days.</p>
    <p>Oh, that ball! I lay my pen on the table and my head in my hands
      and see
      the bright, pretty faces of young girls and richly clad cavaliers,
      and
      hear the echoes of that music so different from what we have
      to-day. Alas!
      the larger part of that company are sleeping now in the cemetery
      of St.
      Martinville.</p>
    <p>Wherever you went, whoever you met, the ball was the subject of
      all
      conversation. All the costumes, masculine and feminine, were
      prepared in
      profound secrecy. Each one vowed to astonish, dazzle, surpass his
      neighbor. My father, forgetting the presents from Alix, gave us
      ever so
      much money and begged Madame du Clozel to oversee our toilets; but
      what
      was the astonishment of the dear baroness to see us buy only some
      vials of
      perfumery and two papers of pins. We paid ten dollars for each
      vial and
      fifteen for the pins!</p>
    <p>Celeste invited us to see her costume the moment it reached her.
      It
      certainly did great honor to the dressmaker of St. Martinville.
      The dress
      was simply made, of very fine white muslin caught up <i>en
        paniers</i> on a
      skirt of blue satin. Her beautiful black hair was to be fastened
      with a
      pearl comb, and to go between its riquettes she showed us two
      bunches of
      forget-me-nots as blue as her eyes. The extremely long-pointed
      waist of
      her dress was of the same color as the petticoat, was
      decollet&eacute;, and on
      the front had a drapery of white muslin held in place by a bunch
      of
      forget-me-nots falling to the end of the point. In the whole
      village she
      could get no white gloves. She would have to let that pass and
      show her
      round white arms clasped with two large bracelets of pearls. She
      showed
      also a necklace and earrings of pearls.</p>
    <p>Madame du Clozel, slave to the severe etiquette of that day, did
      not
      question us, but did go so far as to say in our presence that
      camayeu was
      never worn at night.</p>
    <p>"We know that, madame," replied my sister, slightly hurt. We
      decided to
      show our dresses to our hostess. We arranged them on the bed. When
      the
      baroness and her daughter entered our chamber they stood
      stupefied. The
      baroness spoke first.</p>
    <p>"Oh, the villains! How they have fooled us! These things are
      worthy of a
      queen. They are court costumes."</p>
    <p>I said to myself, "Poor, dear little Alix!"</p>

    <h3>THE DISCOVERY OF THE HAT</h3>
    <p>"Oh!" cried Celeste, "but what will Tonton say when she sees
      you?"</p>
    <p>"Do not let her know a thing about it, girls," said Madame du
      Clozel, "or,
      rather than yield the scepter of beauty and elegance for but one
      evening,
      she will stay in the white chapel. What! at sixteen you don't know
      what
      the white chapel is? It is our bed."</p>
    <p>Before the ball, came Sunday. Madame du Clozel had told us that
      the
      population of the little city&#8212;all Catholics&#8212;was very pious, that
      the
      little church could hardly contain the crowd of worshipers; and
      Celeste
      had said that there was a grand display of dress there. We thought
      of
      having new dresses made, but the dressmaker declared it
      impossible; and so
      we were obliged to wear our camayeus a second time, adding only a
      lace
      scarf and a hat. A hat! But how could one get in that little town
      in the
      wilderness, amid a maze of lakes and bayous, hundreds of miles
      from New
      Orleans, so rare and novel a thing as a hat? Ah, they call
      necessity the
      mother of invention, but I declare, from experience, that vanity
      has
      performed more miracles of invention, and made greater discoveries
      than
      Galileo or Columbus.</p>
    <p>The women of St. Martinville, Tonton at their head, had revolted
      against
      fate and declared they would have hats if they had to get them at
      the
      moon. Behold, now, by what a simple accident the hat was
      discovered.
      Tonton de Blanc had one of the prettiest complexions in the world,
      all
      lily and rose, and what care she took of it! She never went into
      the yard
      or the garden without a sunbonnet and a thick veil. Yet for all
      that her
      jealous critics said she was good and sensible, and would forget
      everything, even her toilet, to succor any one in trouble. One day
      Tonton
      heard a great noise in the street before her door. She was told
      that a
      child had just been crushed by a vehicle. Without stopping to ask
      whether
      the child was white or black or if it still lived, Tonton glanced
      around
      for her sun-bonnet, but, not finding it at hand, darted bareheaded
      into
      the street. At the door she met her young brother, and, as the sun
      was
      hot, she took his hat and put it on her own head. The Rubicon was
      crossed&#8212;Tonton had discovered the hat!</p>
    <p>All she had heard was a false alarm. The crushed child was at
      play again
      before its mother's door. It had been startled by a galoping team,
      had
      screamed, and instantly there had been a great hubbub and crowd.
      But ten
      minutes later the little widow, the hat in her hand, entered the
      domicile
      of its maker and astonished the woman by ordering a hat for her
      own use,
      promising five dollars if the work was done to her satisfaction.
      The
      palmetto was to be split into the finest possible strips and
      platted into
      the form furnished by Madame Tonton. It was done; and on Sunday
      the hat,
      trimmed with roses and ribbons, made its appearance in the church
      of St.
      Martin, on the prettiest head in the world. The next Sunday you
      could see
      as many hats as the hatmaker had had time to make, and before the
      end of
      the month all the women in St. Martinville were wearing palmetto
      hats.
      To-day the modistes were furnishing them at the fabulous price of
      twenty-five dollars,&#8212;trimmed, you understand,&#8212;and palmetto hats
      were
      really getting to be a branch of the commerce of the little city;
      but
      ours, thanks to Alix's flowers and ribbons, cost but ten dollars.</p>
    <p>The church was crowded. The service, performed by an old priest
      nearly a
      hundred years of age, was listened to with interest; but what
      astonished
      me was to see the crowd stop at the church door, the women
      kissing; to
      hear laughter, chat, and criticism at the door of this sacred
      place as if
      it were the public square. I understood the discontent that knit
      my
      father's brows and the alacrity with which he descended the church
      steps.
      Tonton saw and came to us&#8212;so fresh, so young, she was indeed the
      queen of
      beauty and fashion. Out of nothing Tonton could work wonders. Her
      dress
      to-day was of camayeu the pattern of which was bunches of
      strawberries&#8212;the very same stuff as our dresses; but how had she
      made it
      to look so different? And her hat! It was a new marvel of her
      invention.
      She had taken a man's felt hat and entirely covered it with the
      feathers
      of the cardinal bird, without other ornament than a bunch of white
      ribbon
      on the front and two long cords of white silk falling clear to the
      waist.
      That was the first hat of the kind I ever saw, but it was not the
      last.
      With one turn of her little hand she could make the whole female
      population of St. Martinville go as she pleased. Before we left
      St.
      Martinville we had the chance to admire more than fifty hats
      covered with
      the feathers of peacocks, geese, and even guinea-fowl, and&#8212;must we
      confess it?&#8212;when we got home we enlisted all our hunter friends to
      bring
      us numerous innocent cardinals, and tried to make us hats; but
      they did
      not look the least like the pretty widow's.</p>
    <p>Sunday was also the day given to visiting. Being already dressed,
      it was
      so easy to go see one's friends.... Among the new visitors was
      Saint Marc
      d'Arby&#8212;engaged to little Constance de Blanc, aged thirteen. He
      came to
      invite us to a picnic on the coming Wednesday.</p>
    <p>"Ah," I cried, with regret, "the very day papa has chosen for us
      to leave
      for the town of Opelousas!" ...</p>
    <p>Since arriving in St. Martinville we had hardly seen papa. He
      left early
      each morning and returned late in the evening, telling of lands he
      had
      bought during the day. His wish was to go to Opelousas to register
      them.... To-day the whole town of Opelousas belongs to his heirs;
      but
      those heirs, with Creole heedlessness and afraid to spend a
      dollar, let
      strangers enjoy the possession of the beautiful lands acquired by
      their
      ancestor for so different an end. Shame on all of them!</p>
    <p>It was decided for papa to leave us with the baroness during his
      visit to
      Opelousas.</p>
    <p>"And be ready to depart homeward," said he, "on the following
      Monday."</p>

    <h3>THE BALL.</h3>
    <p>The evening before that of the ball gave us lively
      disappointment. A fine
      rain began to fall. But Celeste came to assure us that in St.
      Martinville
      a storm had never prevented a ball, and if one had to go by boat,
      still
      one had to go. Later the weather improved, and several young
      gentlemen
      came to visit us.... "Will there be a supper, chevalier?" asked
      the
      baroness of her future son-in-law.&#8212;"Ah, good! For me the supper is
      the
      best part of the affair."</p>
    <p>Alas! man proposes. The next morning she was in bed suffering
      greatly with
      her throat. "Neither supper nor ball for me this evening," she
      said. "The
      Countess de la Houssaye will take care of you and Celeste this
      evening."...</p>
    <p>At last our toilets were complete....</p>
    <p>When Madame de la Houssaye opened the door and saw us, instead of
      approaching, she suddenly stopped with her hands clasped
      convulsively, and
      with eyes dilated and a pallor and look of astonishment that I
      shall never
      forget. I was about to speak when she ran to Suzanne and seized
      her by the
      arm.</p>
    <p>"Child! for pity answer me! Where did that dress&#8212;these jewels,
      come
      from?"</p>
    <p>"Madame!" said my sister, quickly taking offense.</p>
    <p>"Fran&ccedil;oise!" cried the countess, "you will answer me.
      Listen. The last
      time I saw the Countess Aur&eacute;lie de Morainville, six years
      ago, was at a
      reception of Queen Marie Antoinette, and she wore a dress exactly
      like
      that of Suzanne's. My child, pity my emotions and tell me where
      you bought
      that toilet." I answered, almost as deeply moved as she:</p>
    <p>"We did not buy it, madame. These costumes were given to us by
      Madame
      Carpentier."</p>
    <p>"Given! Do you know the price of these things?"</p>
    <p>"Yes; and, moreover, Madame du Clozel has told us."</p>
    <p>"And you tell me a poor woman, the wife of a gardener, made you
      these
      presents. Oh! I must see this Madame Carpentier. She must have
      known Alix.
      And who knows&#8212;oh, yes, yes! I must go myself and see her."</p>
    <p>"And I must give her forewarning," I said to myself. But, alas!
      as I have
      just said, "Man proposes, God disposes." About six months after
      our return
      to St. James we heard of the death of the Countess de la Houssaye,
      which
      had occurred only two months after our leaving St. Martinville....</p>
    <hr style="width: 45%;">
    <p>Oh, how my heart beat as I saw the lights of the ball-room and
      heard its
      waves of harmony! I had already attended several dances in the
      neighborhood of our home, but they could not compare with this.
      The walls
      were entirely covered with green branches mingled with flowers of
      all
      colors, especially with magnolias whose odor filled the room.
      Hidden among
      the leaves were millions of fantastically colored lampions seeming
      like
      so many glow-worms.<a name="FNanchor21"></a><a href="#Footnote21">[21]</a>
      To me, poor little rustic of sixteen, it seemed
      supernaturally beautiful. But the prettiest part&#8212;opposite the door
      had
      been raised a platform surmounted by a dais made of three flags:
      the
      French, Spanish, and Prussian&#8212;Prussia was papa's country. And
      under these
      colors, on a pedestal that supported them, were seen, in immense
      letters
      composed of flowers, the one German word, <i>Bewillkommen</i>!
      Papa explained
      that the word meant "Welcome." On the platform, attired with
      inconceivable
      elegance, was the master of ceremonies, the handsome Neville
      D&eacute;clouet
      himself, waiting to wish us welcome anew.</p>
    <p>It would take volumes, my daughter, to describe the admirable
      toilets,
      masculine as well as feminine, of that memorable night. The thing
      is
      impossible. But I must describe that of the king of the festival,
      the
      young Neville, that you may understand the immense difference
      between the
      toilets of 1795 and those of 1822.</p>
    <p>Neville had arranged his hair exactly as on the day we first saw
      him. It
      was powdered white; his pigeon-wings were fastened with the same
      pins of
      gold, and his long queue was wrapped with a rose-colored ribbon.
      His coat
      was of frosted rose silk with broad facings of black velvet. His
      vest came
      down nearly to his knees. It also was of rose silk, but covered
      with black
      buttons. His breeches, also rose, were fastened at the knees with
      black
      velvet ribbons escaping from diamond buckles and falling upon silk
      stockings shot alternately with black and rose. Diamonds sparkled
      again on
      his lace frill, at his wrists, on his cravat of rose silk, and on
      the
      buckles of his pumps.</p>
    <p>I cast my eye around to find Tonton, but she had not come. Some
      one near
      me said, "Do you know who will escort Madame du Rocher to the
      ball?" And
      another said, "Here is Neville, so who will replace him at the
      side of the
      pretty widow?"</p>
    <p>As we entered the room the Baron du Clozel passed his arm under
      papa's and
      conducted him to the platform, while his sons, following, drew us
      forward
      to receive the tributes prepared for us. Neville bowed low and
      began his
      address. At first he spoke with feeling and eloquence, but by and
      by he
      lost the thread. He cast a look of despair upon the crowd, which
      did not
      conceal its disposition to laugh, turned again quickly towards us,
      passed
      his hand twice across his forehead, and finished with:</p>
    <p>"Yes, I repeat it, we are glad to see you; you are welcome among
      us,
      and&#8212;I say to you only that!"</p>
    <p>There was a general burst of laughter. But my father pitied the
      young
      man's embarrassment. He mounted the platform, shook his hand, and
      thanked
      him, as well as all the people of St. Martinville, for his
      gracious
      welcome and their warm hospitality. Then, to our great joy, the
      ball
      opened.</p>
    <p>It began with a minuet danced by twelve couples at once, six on
      each side.
      The minuet in vogue just then was well danced by but few persons.
      It had
      been brought to St. Martinville by &eacute;migr&eacute;s who had
      danced it at the
      French court ... But, thanks to the lessons given us by Alix, we
      had the
      pleasure to surprise them.</p>
    <p>Now I ought to tell you, my daughter, that these male costumes,
      so
      effeminate, extravagant, and costly, had met great opposition from
      part of
      the people of St. Martin parish. They had been brought in by the
      French
      &eacute;migr&eacute;s, and many had adopted them, while others had
      openly revolted
      against them. A league had been formed against them. Among its
      members
      were the Chevalier de Blanc, the elder of the d'Arbys, the
      Chevalier de la
      Houssaye, brother of the count, Paul Briant, Adrian Dumartrait,
      young
      Morse, and many others. They had thrown off entirely the
      fashionable dress
      and had replaced it with an attire much like what men wear now. It
      was
      rumored that the pretty Tonton favored the reform of which her
      brother was
      one of the chiefs.</p>
    <p>Just as the minuet was being finished a loud murmur ran through
      the hall.
      All eyes were turned to the door and some couples confused their
      steps in
      the dance. Tonton had come. She was received with a cry of
      surprise; not
      for her beauty, not for her exquisite toilet, but because of him
      who
      entered with her.</p>
    <p>"Great God!" exclaimed Celeste du Clozel, "it is Tr&eacute;ville
      de Saint
      Julien!"&#8212;"Oh!" cried Madame de la Houssaye, "Tonton is a fool, an
      arch-fool. Does she want to see bloodshed this evening?"&#8212;"The
      Countess
      Madelaine is going to faint!" derisively whispered Olivier in my
      ear.</p>
    <p>"Who," asked Suzanne, "is Tr&eacute;ville de Saint Julien?"</p>
    <p>"He is 'the hermit of Bayou Tortue,'" responded the gentle
      Celeste de
      Blanc.</p>
    <p>"What pretense of simplicity, look you!" said Charles du Clozel,
      glancing
      towards him disdainfully.</p>
    <p>"But look at Madame du Rocher," cried a girl standing on a bench,
      "how she
      is dressed. What contempt of fashion and propriety! It is
      positively
      shameful."</p>
    <p>And Tonton, indifferent to these remarks, which she heard and to
      which she
      was accustomed, and to the furious glances thrown upon her
      cavalier by
      Neville D&eacute;clouet, continued, with her arm in his, to chat
      and laugh with
      him as they walked slowly around the hall.</p>
    <p>If I describe to you, my daughter, the toilets of Tonton and of
      Tr&eacute;ville
      de Saint Julien, I write it for you alone, dear child, and it
      seems to me
      it would be a theft against you if I did not. But this is the last
      time I
      shall stop to describe petticoats, gowns, and knee-breeches.
      Tr&eacute;ville was
      twenty-five; large, dark, of a manly, somber beauty. A great
      unhappiness
      had overtaken him in childhood and left a permanent trace on his
      forehead.
      He wore his hair slightly long, falling behind without queue or
      powder. In
      1795 only soldiers retained their beard. Tr&eacute;ville de Saint
      Julien, despite
      the fashion, kept the fine black mustache on his proud lip. His
      shirt,
      without a frill, was fastened with three gold buttons. His
      broad-skirted
      coat, long vest, and breeches were of black woolen stuff. His
      black
      stockings were also of wool. His garters and shoes were without
      buckles.
      But serving him as a garter, and forming a rosette on the front of
      the
      leg, he wore a ribbon of plaided rose and black.</p>
    <p>And Tonton. Over a dress&#8212;a real dress, such as we have
      nowadays&#8212;of rose
      satin, with long-pointed waist, was draped another, of black lace.
      The
      folds, running entirely around the skirt, were caught up by roses
      surrounded by their buds and leaves. The same drapery was repeated
      on the
      waist, and in front and on the shoulders re-appeared the roses.
      The
      sleeves were very short, and the arms bare and without gloves. It
      was
      simple, but prettier than you can think. Her hair was in two wide
      braids,
      without powder, forming a heart and falling low upon the neck.
      Among these
      tresses she had placed a rose like those on the skirt. For
      ornaments she
      had only a necklace and bracelets of jet to heighten the fresh
      whiteness
      of her complexion.</p>
    <p>They had said Tonton would die of jealousy at our rich toilets.
      Nothing of
      the sort. She came to us with her habitual grace, kissed us,
      ignoring
      etiquette and the big eyes made by the Countess Madelaine. Without
      an
      allusion to our dress or seeming to see it, she sat down between
      us, told
      us persons' names, pointed out the beauty of this one, the pretty
      dress of
      that one, always admiring, never criticising. She knew well she
      was
      without a rival.</p>
    <p>I amused myself watching Tr&eacute;ville and Neville out of the
      corner of my
      eyes. Tr&eacute;ville seemed to see but one woman in the room. He
      danced several
      times, always with her, and when he did not dance he went aside,
      spoke
      with no one, but followed with his glances her whom he seemed to
      adore. He
      made no attempt to hide his adoration; it shone from his eyes: his
      every
      movement was full of it. When she returned to her place, he came,
      remained
      before her chair, leaned towards her, listened with ravished ear,
      and
      rarely sat down by her side. It was good to watch Neville. His
      eyes
      flashed with anger, his fists fidgeted, and more than once I saw
      him quit
      the hall, no doubt to make a quarrel with his rival. Not once did
      he come
      near Tonton! Not once did he dance with her! But he danced with
      all the
      young girls in the room and pretended to be very gay. While I was
      dancing
      with him I said:</p>
    <p>"How pretty Tonton is this evening!" And I understood the spite
      that made
      him reply:</p>
    <p>"Ah! mademoiselle, her beauty is certainly not to be compared
      with yours."</p>
    <p>After the supper, which was magnificent, the bolero was danced.
      Twelve
      couples were engaged, continually changing partners. Tonton danced
      with
      Tr&eacute;ville, Suzanne with Olivier, and I with Neville.</p>
    <p>Alas, alas! all things earthly have an end, and at two in the
      morning the
      ball was over. When we reached our chamber I saw that my sister
      had
      something to tell me.</p>
    <p>"Ah!" said she, "have patience. I will tell you after we get into
      bed."</p>
    <p>[What she told was the still famous Saint Julien feud.
      Tr&eacute;ville and
      Neville were representatives of the two sides in that, one of the
      darkest
      vendettas known in the traditions of Louisiana. The omission of
      this
      episode in the present translation is the only liberty taken with
      the
      original that probably calls for an apology.]</p>

    <h2>XVII.</h2>
    <h3>PICNIC AND FAREWELL.</h3>
    <p>The day of the picnic rose brightly. Oh, what a day we passed
      under those
      grand trees, on the margin of that clear lake full of every
      imaginable
      sort of fish! What various games! What pleasant companions! All
      our
      friends were there except Tr&eacute;ville de Saint Julien, and
      Madame Tonton gave
      her smiles and sweet looks to Neville, who never left her a
      moment. Oh,
      how I regretted that my father was not with us! He had gone to
      Opelousas.
      He had bought several plantations in St. Martin parish, and in a
      region
      called Fausse Pointe, and in another known as the C&ocirc;te
      Gel&eacute;e.</p>
    <p>The days that followed were equally f&ecirc;te days&#8212;a dinner
      here, a dance
      there, and everywhere the most gracious reception. At length came
      the day
      for us to meet at La Fontaine&#8212;a real spring near St. Martinville,
      belonging to Neville D&eacute;clouet's uncle. About five in the
      afternoon we
      gathered on the bank of the bayou. We never saw Tonton twice in
      the same
      dress. To-day she was all in blue. Suddenly the sound of distant
      music,
      and an open flat&#8212;not like our boat&#8212;approached, arched over with
      green
      branches and flowers. Benches stood about, and in the middle the
      orchestra
      played. In the prow stood the captain [Neville D&eacute;clouet],
      and during the
      moments of the journey the music was mingled with the laughter and
      songs
      of our joyous company. About 7 o'clock all the trees about La
      Fontaine
      were illuminated, and Neville led us to a floored place encircled
      by
      magnolia trees in bloom and by garlands running from tree to tree
      and
      mingling their perfume with the languishing odor of the magnolias.
      Only
      heaven can tell how Neville was praised and thanked.</p>
    <p>I felt sure that Tonton's good taste had directed the details.
      There was
      something singular in this young woman. Without education save
      what she
      had taught herself, Tonton spoke with remarkable correctness, and
      found
      means to amuse every one. Her letters were curious to see, not a
      single
      word correctly spelled; yet her style was charming, and I cannot
      express
      the pleasure they gave me, for during more than a year I received
      them by
      every opportunity that presented itself.</p>
    <p>But to return to La Fontaine. About seven the handsome
      Tr&eacute;ville de St.
      Julien came on a horse as black as ebony, and I saw the color
      mount to
      Suzanne's forehead. For a wonder he paid Tonton only the
      attentions
      required by politeness, and the pretty widow, while still queen of
      all,
      belonged that evening entirely to Neville.</p>
    <p>The following Saturday my father arrived. The next day, after
      mass, our
      friends came in a body to say adieu. And on the morrow, amid
      kisses,
      handshaking, regrets, tears, and waving handkerchiefs, we departed
      in the
      carriage that was to bear us far and forever from Little Paris,
      and the
      friends we shall never meet again. Suzanne and I wept like
      children. On
      the fourth day after, the carriage stopped before the door of M.
      Gerbeau's
      house. I must confess we were not over-polite to Mme. Gerbeau. We
      embraced
      her hurriedly, and, leaving my father talking about lands, started
      on a
      run for Alix's dwelling.</p>
    <p>Oh, dear Alix! How happy she seemed to see us again! How proud to
      show us
      the innovations made in her neat little house! With what touching
      care had
      she prepared our chamber! She had wished for a sofa, and Joseph
      had made
      her one and covered it with one of the velvet robes of the
      Countess
      Aurelia de Morainville. And when we went into Alix's own room,
      Suzanne,
      whose eye nothing ever escaped, pointed out to me, half hidden
      behind the
      mosquito-net of the bed, the prettiest little cradle in the world.</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Alix, blushing, "I am blessed. I am perfectly happy."</p>
    <p>We told her all our adventures and pleasures. She wept when she
      heard that
      the Countess de la Houssaye had not forgotten her.</p>
    <p>"You will see her," said Suzanne. "She will come to see you,
      without a
      doubt."</p>
    <p>"Ah, Heaven prevent it! Our destinies are too unlike now. Me
      perhaps the
      Countess Madelaine might welcome affectionately; but Joseph? Oh,
      no! My
      husband's lot is mine; I have no wish for any other. It is better
      that she
      and I remain strangers."</p>
    <p>And Joseph? How he confessed his joy in seeing us!</p>
    <p>During our absence M. Gerbeau had found means for us to return to
      St.
      James. It seems that two little boats, resembling steamboats in
      form, kept
      up a constant trade in wood&#8212;clapboards, <i>pieux</i> [split
      boards], shingles,
      even cordwood&#8212;between the lakes and the Bayou Teche plantation. M.
      Gerbeau had taken his skiff and two oarsmen and gone in search of
      one of
      these boats, which, as he guessed, was not far away. In fact he
      met it in
      Mexican [now Berwick's] Bay, and for two hundred dollars persuaded
      the
      captain to take us to St. James. "Yes," said M. Gerbeau to us,
      "you will
      make in a week a journey that might have taken you two months."</p>
    <p>The following Monday the captain tied up at M. Gerbeau's landing.
      It was a
      droll affair, his boat. You must have seen on plantations what
      they call a
      horse-mill&#8212;a long pole on which a man sits, and to which a horse
      or mule
      is hitched. Such was the machinery by which we moved. The boat's
      cabin was
      all one room. The berths, one above another, ran all round the
      room, hung
      with long curtains, and men, women, and children&#8212;when there were
      any&#8212;were all obliged to stay in the same apartment.</p>
    <p>We remained with Alix to the last moment. The morning we left she
      gave
      Suzanne a pretty ring, and me a locket containing her portrait. In
      return
      my sister placed upon her finger a ruby encircled with little
      diamonds;
      and I, taking off the gold medal I always wore on my neck,
      whispered:</p>
    <p>"Wear it for love of me."</p>
    <p>She smiled. [Just as we were parting she handed me the story of
      her
      life.<a name="FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote22">[22]</a>]</p>
    <p>At an early hour my father had our trunks, baskets, and mats sent
      aboard
      the <i>Sir&egrave;ne</i>; and after many tears, and promises to
      write and to return,
      we took our leave. We had quitted St. James the 20th of May. We
      landed
      there once more on the 26th of September. Need I recount the joy
      of my
      mother and sisters? You understand all that.</p>
    <p>And now, my daughter, the tale is told. Read it to your children
      and
      assure them that all is true; that there is here no exaggeration;
      that
      they can put faith in their old grandmother's story and take their
      part in
      her pleasures, her friendships, and her emotions.</p>

    <h2>ALIX DE MORAINVILLE</h2>
    <h3>1773-95.</h3>
    <p><i>Written in Louisiana this 22d of August, 1795, for my dear
        friends
        Suzanne and Fran&ccedil;oise Bossier</i>.</p>
    <p>I have promised you the story of my life, my very dear and good
      friends
      with whom I have had so much pleasure on board the flatboat which
      has
      brought us all to Attakapas. I now make good my promise.</p>
    <p>And first I must speak of the place where I was born, of the
      beautiful
      Ch&acirc;teau de Morainville, built above the little village named
      Morainville
      in honor of its lords. This village, situated in Normandy on the
      margin of
      the sea, was peopled only and entirely by fishermen, who gained a
      livelihood openly by sardine-fishing, and secretly, it was said,
      by
      smuggling. The ch&acirc;teau was built on a cliff, which it
      completely occupied.
      This cliff was formed of several terraces that rose in a stair one
      above
      another. On the topmost one sat the ch&acirc;teau, like an eagle
      in its nest. It
      had four dentilated turrets, with great casements and immense
      galleries,
      that gave it the grandest possible aspect. On the second terrace
      you found
      yourself in the midst of delightful gardens adorned with statues
      and
      fountains after the fashion of the times. Then came the avenue,
      entirely
      overshaded with trees as old as Noah, and everywhere on the hill,
      forming
      the background of the picture, an immense park. How my Suzanne
      would have
      loved to hunt in that beautiful park full of deer, hare, and all
      sorts of
      feathered game!</p>
    <p>And yet no one inhabited that beautiful domain. Its lord and
      mistress, the
      Count Gaston and Countess Aur&eacute;lie, my father and mother,
      resided in Paris,
      and came to their ch&acirc;teau only during the hunting season,
      their sojourn
      never exceeding six weeks.</p>
    <p>Already they had been five years married. The countess, a lady of
      honor to
      the young dauphine, Marie Antoinette, bore the well-merited
      reputation of
      being the most charming woman at the court of the king, Louis the
      Fifteenth. Count and countess, wealthy as they were and happy as
      they
      seemed to be, were not overmuch so, because of their desire for a
      son; for
      one thing, which is not seen in this country, you will not doubt,
      dear
      girls, exists in France and other countries of Europe: it is the
      eldest
      son, and never the daughter, who inherits the fortune and titles
      of the
      family. And in case there were no children, the titles and fortune
      of the
      Morainvilles would have to revert in one lump to the nephew of the
      count
      and son of his brother, to Abner de Morainville, who at that time
      was a
      mere babe of four years. This did not meet the wishes of M. and
      Mme. de
      Morainville, who wished to retain their property in their own
      house.</p>
    <p>But great news comes to Morainville: the countess is with child.
      The
      steward of the ch&acirc;teau receives orders to celebrate the
      event with great
      rejoicings. In the avenue long tables are set covered with all
      sorts of
      inviting meats, the fiddlers are called, and the peasants dance,
      eat, and
      drink to the health of the future heir of the Morainvilles. A few
      months
      later my parents arrived bringing a great company with them; and
      there
      were feasts and balls and hunting-parties without end.</p>
    <p>It was in the course of one of these hunts that my mother was
      thrown from
      her horse. She was hardly in her seventh month when I came into
      the world.
      She escaped death, but I was born as large as&#8212;a mouse! and with
      one
      shoulder much higher than the other.</p>
    <p>I must have died had not the happy thought come to the
      woman-in-waiting to
      procure Catharine, the wife of the gardener, Guillaume Carpentier,
      to be
      my nurse; and it is to her care, to her rubbings, and above all to
      her
      good milk, that I owe the capability to amuse you, my dear girls
      and
      friends, with the account of my life&#8212;that life whose continuance I
      truly
      owe to my mother Catharine.</p>
    <p>When my actual mother had recovered she returned to Paris; and as
      my
      nurse, who had four boys, could not follow her, it was decided
      that I
      should remain at the ch&acirc;teau and that my mother Catharine
      should stay
      there with me.</p>
    <p>Her cottage was situated among the gardens. Her husband, father
      Guillaume,
      was the head gardener, and his four sons were Joseph, aged six
      years; next
      Matthieu, who was four; then Jerome, two; and my foster-brother
      Bastien, a
      big lubber of three months.</p>
    <p>My father and mother did not at all forget me. They sent me
      playthings of
      all sorts, sweetmeats, silken frocks adorned with embroideries and
      laces,
      and all sorts of presents for mother Catharine and her children. I
      was
      happy, very happy, for I was worshiped by all who surrounded me.
      Mother
      Catharine preferred me above her own children. Father Guillaume
      would go
      down upon his knees before me to get a smile [risette], and Joseph
      often
      tells me he swooned when they let him hold me in his arms. It was
      a happy
      time, I assure you; yes, very happy.</p>
    <p>I was two years old when my parents returned, and as they had
      brought a
      great company with them the true mother instructed my nurse to
      take me
      back to her cottage and keep me there, that I might not be
      disturbed by
      noise. Mother Catharine has often said to me that my mother could
      not bear
      to look at my crippled shoulder, and that she called me a
      hunchback. But
      after all it was the truth, and my nurse-mother was wrong to lay
      that
      reproach upon my mother Aur&eacute;lie.</p>
    <p>Seven years passed. I had lived during that time the life of my
      foster-brothers, flitting everywhere with them over the flowery
      grass like
      the veritable lark that I was. Two or three times during that
      period my
      parents came to see me, but without company, quite alone. They
      brought me
      a lot of beautiful things; but really I was afraid of them,
      particularly
      of my mother, who was so beautiful and wore a grand air full of
      dignity
      and self-regard. She would kiss me, but in a way very different
      from
      mother Catharine's way&#8212;squarely on the forehead, a kiss that
      seemed made
      of ice.</p>
    <p>One fine day she arrived at the cottage with a tall, slender lady
      who wore
      blue spectacles on a singularly long nose. She frightened me,
      especially
      when my mother told me that this was my governess, and that I must
      return
      to the ch&acirc;teau with her and live there to learn a host of
      fine things of
      which even the names were to me unknown; for I had never seen a
      book
      except my picture books.</p>
    <p>I uttered piercing cries; but my mother, without paying any
      attention to
      my screams, lifted me cleverly, planted two spanks behind, and
      passed me
      to the hands of Mme. Levicq&#8212;that was the name of my governess. The
      next
      day my mother left me and I repeated my disturbance, crying,
      stamping my
      feet, and calling to mother Catharine and Bastien. (To tell the
      truth,
      Jerome and Matthieu were two big lubbers [rougeots] very peevish
      and
      coarse-mannered, which I could not endure.) Madame put a book into
      my
      hands and wished to have me repeat after her; I threw the book at
      her
      head. Then, rightly enough, in despair she placed me where I could
      see the
      cottage in the midst of the garden and told me that when the
      lesson was
      ended I might go and see my mother Catharine and play with my
      brothers. I
      promptly consented, and that is how I learned to read.</p>
    <p>This Mme. Levicq was most certainly a woman of good sense. She
      had a kind
      heart and much ability. She taught me nearly all I know&#8212;first of
      all,
      French; the harp, the guitar, drawing, embroidery; in short, I say
      again,
      all that I know.</p>
    <p>I was fourteen years old when my mother came, and this time not
      alone. My
      cousin Abner was with her. My mother had me called into her
      chamber,
      closely examined my shoulder, loosed my hair, looked at my teeth,
      made me
      read, sing, play the harp, and when all this was ended smiled and
      said:</p>
    <p>"You are beautiful, my daughter; you have profited by the
      training of your
      governess; the defect of your shoulder has not increased. I am
      satisfied&#8212;well satisfied; and I am going to tell you that I have
      brought
      the Viscomte Abner de Morainville because I have chosen him for
      your
      future husband. Go, join him in the avenue."</p>
    <p>I was a little dismayed at first, but when I had seen my intended
      my
      dismay took flight&#8212;he was such a handsome fellow, dressed with so
      much
      taste, and wore his sword with so much grace and spirit. At the
      end of two
      days he loved me to distraction and I doted on him. I brought him
      to my
      nurse's cabin and told her all our plans of marriage and all my
      happiness,
      not observing the despair of poor Joseph, who had always worshiped
      me and
      who had not doubted he would have me to love. But who would have
      thought
      it&#8212;a laboring gardener lover of his lord's daughter? Ah, I would
      have
      laughed heartily then if I had known it!</p>
    <p>On the evening before my departure&#8212;I had to leave with my mother
      this
      time&#8212;I went to say adieu to mother Catharine. She asked me if I
      loved
      Abner.</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes, mother!" I replied, "I love him with all my soul"; and
      she said
      she was happy to hear it. Then I directed Joseph to go and request
      Monsieur the cur&eacute;, in my name, to give him lessons in
      reading and writing,
      in order to be able to read the letters that I should write to my
      nurse-mother and to answer them. This order was carried out to the
      letter,
      and six months later Joseph was the correspondent of the family
      and read
      to them my letters. That was his whole happiness.</p>
    <p>I had been quite content to leave for Paris: first, because Abner
      went
      with me, and then because I hoped to see a little of all those
      beautiful
      things of which he had spoken to me with so much charm; but how
      was I
      disappointed! My mother kept me but one day at her house, and did
      not even
      allow Abner to come to see me. During that day I must, she said,
      collect
      my thoughts preparatory to entering the convent. For it was
      actually to
      the convent of the Ursulines, of which my father's sister was the
      superior, that she conducted me next day.</p>
    <p>Think of it, dear girls! I was fourteen, but not bigger than a
      lass of
      ten, used to the open air and to the caresses of mother Catharine
      and my
      brothers. It seemed to me as if I were a poor little bird shut in
      a great
      dark cage.</p>
    <p>My aunt, the abbess, Agnes de Morainville, took me to her room,
      gave me
      bonbons and pictures, told me stories, and kissed and caressed me,
      but her
      black gown and her bonnet appalled me, and I cried with all my
      might:</p>
    <p>"I want mother Catharine! I want Joseph! I want Bastien!"</p>
    <p>My aunt, in despair, sent for three or four little pupils to
      amuse me; but
      this was labor lost, and I continued to utter the same outcries.
      At last,
      utterly spent, I fell asleep, and my aunt bore me to my little
      room and
      put me to bed, and then slowly withdrew, leaving the door ajar.</p>
    <p>On the second floor of the convent there were large dormitories,
      where
      some hundreds of children slept; but on the first there were a
      number of
      small chambers, the sole furniture of each being a folding bed, a
      washstand, and a chair, and you had to pay its weight in gold for
      the
      privilege of occupying one of these cells, in order not to be
      mixed with
      the daughters of the bourgeoisie, of lawyers and merchants. My
      mother, who
      was very proud, had exacted absolutely that they give me one of
      these
      select cells.</p>
    <p>Hardly had my aunt left me when I awoke, and fear joined itself
      to grief.
      Fancy it! I had never lain down in a room alone, and here I awoke
      in a
      corner of a room half lighted by a lamp hung from the ceiling. You
      can
      guess I began again my writhings and cries. Thereupon appeared
      before me
      in the open door the most beautiful creature imaginable. I took
      her for a
      fairy, and fell to gazing at her with my eyes full of amazement
      and
      admiration. You have seen Madelaine, and you can judge of her
      beauty in
      her early youth. It was a fabulous beauty joined to a manner fair,
      regal,
      and good.</p>
    <p>She took me in her arms, dried my tears, and at last, at the
      extremity of
      her resources, carried me to her bed; and when I awoke the next
      day I
      found myself still in the arms of Madelaine de Livilier. From that
      moment
      began between us that great and good friendship which was
      everything for
      me during the time that I passed in the convent. I should have
      died of
      loneliness and grief without Madelaine. I had neither brothers nor
      sisters; she was both these to me: she was older than I, and
      protected me
      while she loved me.</p>
    <p>She was the niece of the rich Cardinal de S&eacute;gur, who had
      sent and brought
      her from Louisiana. This is why Madelaine had such large
      privileges at the
      convent. She told me she was engaged to the young Count Louis le
      Pelletrier de la Houssaye, and I, with some change of color, told
      her of
      Abner.</p>
    <p>One day Madelaine's aunt, the Countess de S&eacute;gur, came to
      take her to spend
      the day at her palace. My dear friend besought her aunt with such
      graciousness that she obtained permission to take me with her, and
      for the
      first time I saw the Count Louis, Madelaine's <i>fianc&eacute;</i>.
      He was a very
      handsome young man, of majestic and distinguished air. He had hair
      and
      eyes as black as ink, red lips, and a fine mustache. He wore in
      his
      buttonhole the cross of the royal order of St. Louis, and on his
      shoulders
      the epaulettes of a major. He had lately come from San Domingo
      [where he
      had been fighting the insurgents at the head of his regiment].<a
        name="FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote23">[23]</a> Yes, he
      was a handsome young man, a bold cavalier; and Madelaine idolized
      him.
      After that day I often accompanied my friend in her visits to the
      home of
      her aunt. Count Louis was always there to wait upon his betrothed,
      and
      Abner, apprised by him, came to join us. Ah! that was a happy
      time, very
      happy.</p>
    <p>At the end of a year my dear Madelaine quitted the convent to be
      married.
      Ah, how I wept to see her go! I loved her so! I had neither
      brothers nor
      sisters, and Madelaine was my heart's own sister. I was very
      young,
      scarcely fifteen; yet, despite my extreme youth, Madelaine desired
      me to
      be her bridesmaid, and her aunt, the Countess de S&eacute;gur, and
      the Baroness
      de Chevign&eacute;, Count Louis's aunt, went together to find my
      mother and ask
      her to permit me to fill that office. My mother made many
      objections,
      saying that I was too young; but&#8212;between you and me&#8212;she could
      refuse
      nothing to ladies of such high station. She consented, therefore,
      and
      proceeded at once to order my costume at the dressmaker's.</p>
    <p>It was a mass of white silk and lace with intermingled pearls.
      For the
      occasion my mother lent me her pearls, which were of great
      magnificence.
      But, finest of all, the Queen, Marie Antoinette, saw me at the
      church of
      Notre Dame, whither all the court had gathered for the
      occasion,&#8212;for
      Count Louis de la Houssaye was a great favorite,&#8212;and now the queen
      sent
      one of her lords to apprise my mother that she wished to see me,
      and
      commanded that I be presented at court&#8212;<i>grande rumeur</i>!</p>
    <p>Mamma consented to let me remain the whole week out of the
      convent. Every
      day there was a grand dinner or breakfast and every evening a
      dance or a
      grand ball. Always it was Abner who accompanied me. I wrote of all
      my
      pleasures to my mother Catharine. Joseph read my letters to her,
      and, as
      he told me in later days, they gave him mortal pain. For the
      presentation
      my mother ordered a suit all of gold and velvet. Madelaine and I
      were
      presented the same day. The Countess de S&eacute;gur was my escort
      [marraine] and
      took me by the hand, while Mme. de Chevign&eacute; rendered the
      same office to
      Madelaine. Abner told me that day I was as pretty as an angel. If
      I was so
      to him, it was because he loved me. I knew, myself, I was too
      small, too
      pale, and ever so different from Madelaine. It was she you should
      have
      seen.</p>
    <p>I went back to the convent, and during the year that I passed
      there I was
      lonely enough to have died. It was decided that I should be
      married
      immediately on leaving the convent, and my mother ordered for me
      the most
      beautiful wedding outfit imaginable. My father bought me jewels of
      every
      sort, and Abner did not spare of beautiful presents.</p>
    <p>I had been about fifteen days out of the convent when terrible
      news caused
      me many tears. My dear Madelaine was about to leave me forever and
      return
      to America. The reason was this: there was much disorder in the
      colony of
      Louisiana, and the king deciding to send thither a man capable of
      restoring order, his choice fell upon Count Louis de la Houssaye,
      whose
      noble character he had recognized. Count Louis would have refused,
      for he
      had a great liking for France; but [he had lately witnessed the
      atrocities
      committed by the negroes of San Domingo, and<a name="FNanchor24"></a><a
        href="#Footnote24">[24]</a>] something&#8212;a
      presentiment&#8212;warned him that the Revolution was near at hand. He
      was glad
      to bear his dear wife far from the scenes of horror that were
      approaching
      with rapid strides.</p>
    <p>Madelaine undoubtedly experienced pleasure in thinking that she
      was again
      going to see her parents and her native land, but she regretted to
      leave
      France, where she had found so much amusement and where I must
      remain
      behind her without hope of our ever seeing each other again. She
      wept, oh,
      so much!</p>
    <p>She had bidden me good-bye and we had wept long, and her last
      evening, the
      eve of the day when she was to take the diligence for Havre, where
      the
      vessel awaited them, was to be passed in family group at the
      residence of
      the Baroness de Chevign&eacute;. Here were present, first the
      young couple; the
      Cardinal, the Count and Countess de S&eacute;gur; then Barthelemy
      de la Houssaye,
      brother of the Count, and the old Count de [Maurepas, only a few
      months
      returned from exile and now at the pinnacle of royal favor].[24]
      He had
      said when he came that he could stay but a few hours and had
      ordered his
      coach to await him below. He was the most lovable old man in the
      world.
      All at once Madelaine said:</p>
    <p>"Ah! if I could see Alix once more&#8212;only once more!"</p>
    <p>The old count without a word slipped away, entered his carriage,
      and had
      himself driven to the Morainville hotel, where there was that
      evening a
      grand ball. Tarrying in the ante-chamber, he had my mother called.
      She
      came with alacrity, and when she knew the object of the count's
      visit she
      sent me to get a great white burnoose, enveloped me in it, and
      putting my
      hand into the count's said to me:</p>
    <p>"You have but to show yourself to secure the carriage." But the
      count
      promised to bring me back himself.</p>
    <p>Oh, how glad my dear Madelaine was to see me! With what joy she
      kissed me!
      But she has recounted this little scene to you, as you,
      Fran&ccedil;oise, have
      told me.</p>
    <p>A month after the departure of the De la Houssayes, my wedding
      was
      celebrated at Notre Dame. It was a grand occasion. The king was
      present
      with all the court. As my husband was in the king's service, the
      queen
      wished me to become one of her ladies of honor.</p>
    <p>Directly after my marriage I had Bastien come to me. I made him
      my
      confidential servant. He rode behind my carriage, waited upon me
      at table,
      and, in short, was my man of all work.</p>
    <p>I was married the 16th of March, 1789, at the age of sixteen.
      Already the
      rumbling murmurs of the Revolution were making themselves heard
      like
      distant thunder. On the 13th of July the Bastille was taken and
      the head
      of the governor De Launay [was] carried through the streets.<a
        name="FNanchor25"></a><a href="#Footnote25">[25]</a> My mother
      was frightened and proposed to leave the country. She came to find
      me and
      implored me to go with her to England, and asked Abner to
      accompany us.
      My husband refused with indignation, declaring that his place was
      near his
      king.</p>
    <p>"And mine near my husband," said I, throwing my arms around
      Abner's neck.</p>
    <p>My father, like my husband, had refused positively to leave the
      king, and
      it was decided that mamma should go alone. She began by visiting
      the
      shops, and bought stuffs, ribbons, and laces. It was I who helped
      her pack
      her trunks, which she sent in advance to Morainville. She did not
      dare go
      to get her diamonds, which were locked up in the Bank of France;
      that
      would excite suspicion, and she had to content herself with such
      jewelry
      as she had at her residence. She left in a coach with my father,
      saying as
      she embraced me that her absence would be brief, for it would be
      easy
      enough to crush the vile mob. She went down to Morainville, and
      there,
      thanks to the devotion of Guillaume Carpentier and of his sons,
      she was
      carried to England in a contrabandist vessel. As she was
      accustomed to
      luxury, she put into her trunks the plate of the ch&acirc;teau and
      also several
      valuable pictures. My father had given her sixty thousand francs
      and
      charged her to be economical.</p>
    <p>Soon I found myself in the midst of terrible scenes that I have
      not the
      courage, my dear girls, to recount. The memory of them makes me
      even
      to-day tremble and turn pale. I will only tell you that one
      evening a
      furious populace entered our palace. I saw my husband dragged far
      from me
      by those wretches, and just as two of the monsters were about to
      seize me
      Bastien took me into his arms, and holding me tightly against his
      bosom
      leaped from a window and took to flight with all his speed.</p>
    <p>Happy for us that it was night and that the monsters were busy
      pillaging
      the house. They did not pursue us at all, and my faithful Bastien
      took me
      to the home of his cousin Claudine Leroy. She was a worker in
      lace, whom,
      with my consent, he was to have married within the next fortnight.
      I had
      lost consciousness, but Claudine and Bastien cared for me so well
      that
      they brought me back to life, and I came to myself to learn that
      my father
      and my husband had been arrested and conveyed to the Conciergerie.</p>
    <p>My despair was great, as you may well think. Claudine arranged a
      bed for
      me in a closet [cloisette] adjoining her chamber, and there I
      remained
      hidden, dying of fear and grief, as you may well suppose.</p>
    <p>At the end of four days I heard some one come into Claudine's
      room, and
      then a deep male voice. My heart ceased to beat and I was about to
      faint
      away, when I recognized the voice of my faithful Joseph. I opened
      the door
      and threw myself upon his breast, crying over and over:</p>
    <p>"O Joseph! dear Joseph!"</p>
    <p>He pressed me to his bosom, giving me every sort of endearing
      name, and at
      length revealed to me the plan he had formed, to take me at once
      to
      Morainville under the name of Claudine Leroy. He went out with
      Claudine to
      obtain a passport. Thanks to God and good angels Claudine was
      small like
      me, had black hair and eyes like mine, and there was no trouble in
      arranging the passport. We took the diligence, and as I was
      clothed in
      peasant dress, a suit of Claudine's, I easily passed for her.</p>
    <p>Joseph had the diligence stop beside the park gate, of which he
      had
      brought the key. He wished to avoid the village. We entered
      therefore by
      the park, and soon I was installed in the cottage of my adopted
      parents,
      and Joseph and his brothers said to every one that Claudine Leroy,
      appalled by the horrors being committed in Paris, had come for
      refuge to
      Morainville.</p>
    <p>Then Joseph went back to Paris to try to save my father and my
      husband.
      Bastien had already got himself engaged as an assistant in the
      prison. But
      alas! all their efforts could effect nothing, and the only
      consolation
      that Joseph brought back to Morainville was that he had seen its
      lords on
      the fatal cart and had received my father's last smile. These
      frightful
      tidings failed to kill me; I lay a month between life and death,
      and
      Joseph, not to expose me to the recognition of the Morainville
      physician,
      went and brought one from Rouen. The good care of mother Catharine
      was the
      best medicine for me, and I was cured to weep over my fate and my
      cruel
      losses.</p>
    <p>It was at this juncture that for the first time I suspected that
      Joseph
      loved me. His eyes followed me with a most touching expression; he
      paled
      and blushed when I spoke to him, and I divined the love which the
      poor
      fellow could not conceal. It gave me pain to see how he loved me,
      and
      increased my wish to join my mother in England. I knew she had
      need of me,
      and I had need of her.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile a letter came to the address of father Guillaume. It
      was a
      contrabandist vessel that brought<br>
      it and<br>
      of the first evening<br>
      other to the address<br>
      recognized the writing<br>
      set me to sobbing<br>
      all, my heart<br>
      I began<span style="margin-left: 20em;">(<i>Torn off and gone</i>.)</span><br>
      demanded of<br>
      my father of<br>
      saying that<br>
      country well<br>
      56<br>
      added that Abner and I must come also, and that it was nonsense to
      wish to
      remain faithful to a lost cause. She begged my father to go and
      draw her
      diamonds from the bank and to send them to her with at least a
      hundred
      thousand francs. Oh! how I wept after seeing<br>
      <span style="margin-left: 24.5em;">letter! Mother Catharine</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 28em;">to console me but</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 27.5em;">then to make. Then</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 26.5em;">and said to me, Will</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 31em;">to make you</span><br>
      (<i>Torn off and gone</i>.)<span style="margin-left: 17em;">England,
        Madame</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 29em;">Oh! yes, Joseph</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 24.5em;">would be so well pleased</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 31em;">poor fellow</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 30.5em;">the money of</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 32em;">family. I</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>From the way in which, the cabin was built, one could see any one
      coming
      who had business there. But one day&#8212;God knows how it happened&#8212;a
      child of
      the village all at once entered the chamber where I was and knew
      me.</p>
    <p>"Madame Alix!" he cried, took to his heels and went down the
      terrace
      pell-mell [quatre &agrave; quatre] to give the alarm. Ten minutes
      later Matthieu
      came at a full run and covered with sweat, to tell us that all the
      village
      was in commotion and that those people to whom I had always been
      so good
      were about to come and arrest me, to deliver me to the
      executioners. I ran
      to Joseph, beside myself with affright.</p>
    <p>"Save me, Joseph! save me!"</p>
    <p>"I will use all my efforts for that, Mme. la Viscomtesse." At
      that moment
      Jerome appeared. He came to say that a representative of the
      people was at
      hand and that I was lost beyond a doubt.</p>
    <p>"Not yet," responded Joseph. "I have foreseen this and have
      prepared
      everything to save you, Mme. la Viscomtesse, if you will but let
      me make
      myself well understood."</p>
    <p>"Oh, all, all! Do <i>thou</i> understand, Joseph, I will do
      everything thou
      desirest."</p>
    <p>"Then," he said, regarding me fixedly and halting at each
      word&#8212;"then it
      is necessary that you consent to take Joseph Carpentier for your
      spouse."</p>
    <p>I thought I had [been] misunderstood and drew back haughtily.</p>
    <p>"My son!" cried mother Catharine.</p>
    <p>"Oh, you see," replied Joseph, "my mother herself accuses me, and
      you&#8212;you, madame, have no greater confidence in me. But that is
      nothing; I
      must save you at any price. We will go from here together; we will
      descend
      to the village; we will present ourselves at the mayoralty&#8212;"</p>
    <p>In spite of myself I made a gesture.</p>
    <p>"Let me speak, madame," he said. "We have not a moment to lose.
      Yes, we
      will present ourselves at the mayoralty, and there I will espouse
      you, not
      as Claudine Leroy, but as Alix de Morainville. Once my wife you
      have
      nothing to fear. Having become one of the people, the people will
      protect
      you. After the ceremony, madame, I will hand you the certificate
      of our
      marriage, and you will tear it up the moment we shall have touched
      the
      soil of England. Keep it precious till then; it is your only
      safeguard.
      Nothing prevents me from going to England to find employment, and
      necessarily my wife will go with me. Are you ready, madame?"</p>
    <p>For my only response I put my hand in his; I was too deeply moved
      to
      speak. Mother Catharine threw both her arms about her son's neck
      and
      cried, "My noble child!" and we issued from the cottage guarded by
      Guillaume and his three other sons, armed to the teeth.</p>
    <p>When the mayor heard the names and surnames of the wedding pair
      he turned
      to Joseph, saying:</p>
    <p>"You are not lowering yourself, my boy."</p>
    <p>At the door of the mayoralty we found ourselves face to face with
      an
      immense crowd. I trembled violently and pressed against Joseph.
      He, never
      losing his presence of mind [sans perdre la carte], turned,
      saying:</p>
    <p>"Allow me, my friends, to present to you my wife. The Viscomtesse
      de
      Morainville no longer exists; hurrah for the Citoyenne
      Carpentier." And
      the hurrahs and cries of triumph were enough to deafen one. Those
      who the
      moment before were ready to tear me into pieces now wanted to
      carry me in
      triumph. Arrived at the house, Joseph handed me our act of
      marriage.</p>
    <p>"Keep it, madame," said he; "you can destroy it on your arrival
      in
      England."</p>
    <p>At length one day, three weeks after our marriage, Joseph came to
      tell me
      that he had secured passage on a vessel, and that we must sail
      together
      under the name of Citoyen and Citoyenne Carpentier. I was truly
      sorry to
      leave my adopted parents and foster-brother, yet at the bottom of
      my heart
      I was rejoiced that I was going to find my mother.</p>
    <p>But alas! when I arrived in London, at the address that she had
      given me,
      I found there only her old friend the Chevalier d'Ivoy, who told
      me that
      my mother was dead, and that what was left of her money, with her
      jewels
      and chests, was deposited in the Bank of England. I was more dead
      than
      alive; all these things paralyzed me. But my good Joseph took upon
      himself
      to do everything for me. He went and drew what had been deposited
      in the
      bank. Indeed of money there remained but twelve thousand francs;
      but
      there were plate, jewels, pictures, and many vanities in the form
      of gowns
      and every sort of attire.</p>
    <p>Joseph rented a little house in a suburb of London, engaged an
      old
      Frenchwoman to attend me, and he, after all my husband, made
      himself my
      servant, my gardener, my factotum. He ate in the kitchen with the
      maid,
      waited upon me at table, and slept in the garret on a pallet.</p>
    <p>"Am I not very wicked?" said I to myself every day, especially
      when I saw
      his pallor and profound sadness. They had taught me in the convent
      that
      the ties of marriage were a sacred thing and that one could not
      break
      them, no matter how they might have been made; and when my
      patrician pride<br>
      revolted at the thought of this union with the son of my nurse<br>
      my heart pleaded<br>
      and pleaded<br>
      hard the cause<br>
      of poor J<br>
      Joseph. His<span style="margin-left: 18em;">(<i>Evidently torn
          before Alix</i></span><br>
      care, his<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>wrote on it, as no
          words</i></span><br>
      presence, became<span style="margin-left: 15em;"><i>are wanting in
          the text</i>.)</span><br>
      more and more<br>
      necessary. I knew not how to do anything myself, but made him my
      all in
      all, avoiding myself every shadow of care or trouble. I must say,
      moreover, that since he had married me I had a kind of fear of him
      and was
      afraid that I should hear him speak to me of love; but he scarcely
      thought
      of it, poor fellow:<br>
      <br>
      reverence closed his lips. Thus matters stood when<br>
      <span style="margin-left: 30em;">one evening Joseph</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 30em;">entered the room</span><br>
      (<i>Opposite page of the</i><span style="margin-left: 19em;">where
        I was reading,</span><br>
      <i>same torn sheet. Alix</i><span style="margin-left: 19em;"> and
        standing</span><br>

        hat</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 30em;">in his hand, said</span><br>
      to me that he had something to tell me. His expression was so
      unhappy that
      I felt the tears mount to my eyes.</p>
    <p>"What is it, dear Joseph?" I asked; and when he could answer
      nothing on
      account of his emotion, I rose, crying:</p>
    <p>"More bad news? What has happened to my nurse-mother? Speak,
      speak,
      Joseph!"</p>
    <p>"Nothing, Mme. la Viscomtesse," he replied. "My mother and
      Bastien, I
      hope, are well. It is of myself I wish to speak."</p>
    <p>Then my heart made a sad commotion in my bosom, for I thought he
      was about
      to speak of love. But not at all. He began again, in a low voice:</p>
    <p>"I am going to America, madame."</p>
    <p>I sprung towards him. "You go away? You go away?" I cried. "And
      I,
      Joseph?"</p>
    <p>"You, madame?" said he. "You have money. The Revolution will soon
      be over,
      and you can return to your country. There you will find again your
      friends, your titles, your fortune."</p>
    <p>"Stop!" I cried. "What shall I be in France? You well know my
      ch&acirc;teau, my
      palace are pillaged and burned, my parents are dead."</p>
    <p>"My mother and Bastien are in France," he responded.</p>
    <p>"But thou&#8212;thou, Joseph; what can I do without thee? Why have you
      accustomed me to your tenderness, to your protection, and now come
      threatening to leave me? Hear me plainly. If you go I go with
      you."</p>
    <p>He uttered a smothered cry and staggered like a drunken man.</p>
    <p>"Alix&#8212;madame&#8212;"</p>
    <p>"I have guessed your secret," continued I. "You seek to go
      because you
      love me&#8212;because you fear you may forget that respect which you
      fancy you
      owe me. But after all I am your wife, Joseph. I have the right to
      follow
      thee, and I am going with thee." And slowly I drew from my
      dressing-case
      the act of our marriage.</p>
    <p>He looked, at me, oh! in such a funny way, and&#8212;extended his arms.
      I threw
      myself into them, and for half an hour it was tears and kisses and
      words
      of love. For after all I loved Joseph, not as I had loved Abner,
      but
      altogether more profoundly.</p>
    <p>The next day a Catholic priest blessed our marriage. A month
      later we left
      for Louisiana, where Joseph hoped to make a fortune for me. But
      alas! he
      was despairing of success, when he met Mr. Carlo, and&#8212;you know,
      dear
      girls, the rest.</p>
    <hr style="width: 45%;">
    <p>Roll again and slip into its ancient silken case the small,
      square
      manuscript which some one has sewed at the back with worsted of
      the pale
      tint known as "baby-blue." Blessed little word! Time justified the
      color.
      If you doubt it go to the Teche; ask any of the De la Houssayes&#8212;or
      count,
      yourself, the Carpentiers and Charpentiers. You will be more apt
      to quit
      because you are tired than because you have finished. And while
      there ask,
      over on the Attakapas side, for any trace that any one may be able
      to give
      of Dorothea M&uuml;ller. She too was from France: at least, not
      from Normandy
      or Paris, like Alix, but, like Fran&ccedil;oise's young aunt with
      the white hair,
      a German of Alsace, from a village near Strasbourg; like her, an
      emigrant,
      and, like Fran&ccedil;oise, a voyager with father and sister by
      flatboat from old
      New Orleans up the Mississippi, down the Atchafalaya, and into the
      land of
      Attakapas. You may ask, you may seek; but if you find the faintest
      trace
      you will have done what no one else has succeeded in doing. We
      shall never
      know her fate. Her sister's we can tell; and we shall now see how
      different from the stories of Alix and Fran&ccedil;oise is that of
      poor Salome
      M&uuml;ller, even in the same land and almost in the same times.</p>
