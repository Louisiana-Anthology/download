      <p> The old Major, in addition to planting cotton, and retrieving a dissipated fortune, was a great dabbler in horticulture, and had bestowed great attention upon the cultivation of the grape. By much care and grafting, he had so improved upon the common varieties of the country as to render them but slightly inferior to the choicest foreign specimens. An extensive arbour was in the middle of the garden— the finest and most extensive in the swamp—and this was literally covered with the ruddy clusters of grapes, now in the fullest tide of ripeness.</p>
      <p> " Now or never," I say, was the word with Jerry. Making a desperate effort, he faltered out,  &lt;&lt;Miss  Mary, your father has a very fine garden! shall we go look at the grapes ? I am very fond of them. Miss Mary ! do you like grapes, Miss Mary.? Ha! ha!"—the cold sweat bursting out from every pore.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-184"/>
      <p> " Very much, Mr. Wilson, and pa's are really very fine, considering that they have not the quality of being exotics to recommend them to our taste. I will accompany you to taste them with much pleasure," replied Miss Mary; and tripping into the house, soon appeared, with the sweetest little sun-bonnet on, that witching damsel ever wore.</p>
      <p> Jerry, frightened nearly to death at the awful propinquity of the "question popping," could scarcely stand, for his agitation ; and poor Miss Mary, apprehending from Jerry's manner that the garden was destined to become the recipient of some awfully horrible avowal— perhaps Jerry had murdered somebody, and his conscience was forcing him to disclose; or he had discovered that an insurrection of the negroes was contemplated; or—surely he was not going to make a declaration—oh, no! she knew it was not anything of that kind—began to participate in Jerry's embarrassment and trepidation. More like criminals proceeding to execution, than young people going to pluck grapes, they sought the garden ; the gate was closed behind them, and in a few moments more they stood under the arbour.</p>
      <p> The grapes were hanging down upon all sides in the greatest profusion ; and, twining their purple masses together, seemingly cried out, " Come eat us !"</p>
      <p> Jerry was the very picture of terror. Oh! how he wished that he was safe at home! But it was too late to retreat—he could only procrastinate. But still, men had gone as far as walking in a secluded garden with a lady, and then died old bachelors. But then that infernal doctor to-morrow—the die was cast, he would go on. The question was, how should he approach the subject, so as not to destroy life in the young lady, when the dreadful business of his visit was announced  ?     He must prepare</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-185"/>
      <p> her for it gradually—the grapes offered an introductory— the impolite fellow, not to offer her any during the long time they had been in the arbour—they had just a second before reached it.</p>
      <p> Plucking off" a large bunch, he handed them to her, and selected a similar one for himself. They were devoured in silence, Jerry too badly frightened to speak, and Mary wondering what in the world was to come next. The grapes were consumed, another pair of bunches Selected, and the sound of their champing jaws was all that broke the stillness. Jerry's eyes were fixed on his bunch, and Mary was watching the motions of an agile snail. The cluster was in process of disappearance, when Jerry, summoning his whole energies, commenced his declamation: &lt;&lt; Miss Mary,-I have something to impart"—here he came to a full stop, and looked up, as if to draw inspiration from heaven ; but the umbrageous foliage intercepted his view, and only the grapes met his eye—and their juice requires to be gone through with several processes, before much exhilaration or eloquence can be drawn from it. Plucking a quantity, he swallowed them, to relieve his throat, which was becoming strangely dry and harsh.</p>
      <p> Miss Mary, poor girl, was sitting there, very much confused, busily eating grapes ; neither she nor Jerry knew, whilst continuing to eat, the quantity that they had consumed : their thoughts were elsewhere.</p>
      <p> '&lt; Miss Mary," again upspoke Jerry, " you must have seen long before this—but la! your bunch is eaten—have some more grapes. Miss Mary  ?  I like them very much" —and amidst much snubbling and champing, another package of grapes was warehoused by the lovers.</p>
      <p> Jerry's fix was becoming desperate; time was flying' rapidly, and he knew one subject would soon be ex-15*</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-186"/>
      <p> hausted, for lie could eat but few more grapes. Oh ! how he wished that fighting a panther, fist-fight, had been made one of the conventialities of society, and assumed to be declaratory of the soft passion! how quickly would his bride be wooed!—but those infernal words! he could never arrange them so as to express what he meant. " Miss Mary, you must know that I saw Dr. Tensas, to-day, he told me—have some more. Miss Mary, they won't hurt you. I have come expressly to ask you — have another bunch, let me insist. I have come. Miss Mary, to propose—another small bunch"—" Mary, I have come," he almost shrieked, " to ask you to have—only a few more— Oh ! Lord !" and he wiped the cold sweat off. Poor fellow! his pluck would not hold out.</p>
      <p> Mary, frightened at his vehemence, said nothing, but eat on mechanically, anxious to hear what it was that Jerry wished to disclose.</p>
      <p> Again he marshalled his forces: the sun was declining in the west, and the morrow would, perhaps, see the " Swamp Doctor," with his glib tongue, breathing his vows—" Miss Mary, I—I love—grapes—no, you—grapes —will you have me—some grapes—marry me—no grapes —yes, me! Oh ! Lord ! it is all over! You will—bless you—I mustjiave a kiss. You haven't consented yet— but you must!" The barrier seemed to drop, the spell was lifted off his tongue, and Jerry, in a stream of native eloquence, running the fiercer for being so long pent up, plead his cause ; could it be unsuccessful ? Oh ! no! Mary had made up her mind long ago.</p>
      <p> Side by side, now, all their diffidence vanished ; they sat under the blessed arbour, and discoursed of their past fears, and bright hopes for the future! Jerry held the head of his mistress on his leal and noble breast, and, as in a sweet and pure strain he pictured forth the quiet do-</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-187"/>
      <p> mestic life they were to lead when married, Mary could scarcely believe that the impudent fellow who now talked so glibly, and stole, in spite of her rebukes, kisses unnumbered, was the timid nervous swain of a few minutes before.</p>
      <p> But lo! behold what a sudden transformation! Has Jerry struck some discordant note in his sweet melody of the future—for Mary's features are contracted, as if with pain, and her pretty face, in spite of herself, wears a vinegar aspect. Rather early, I opine, for ladies to commence the shrew—if I am wrong, lady reader, attribute the error to the ignorance of an old bachelor. Jerry, too, seems to partake of the sour contagion—he stamps upon the ground, writhes his body about, and presses his hand upon his stomach, ignorant, I presume, of anatomy. He meant to lay them over his heart, poor fellow! he got too low down. Mary, too, is evincing the ardency of her affection ; and with the same deplorable ignorance of the locality of the organs. Verily, love is affecting them, singularly. It may be a pleasant passion, but that couple, who certainly have a fresh, I will not say genuine, article of love, look like anything but happy accepted lovers. What can be the matter.'' They have just read an extract from one of Cowper's  hu-colics —but can poetry produce such an effect ? They groan, and writhe their bodies about, and would press their hearts, if  they  only lay where their digestive apparatus certainly does. Can the grapes have anything to do with their queer contortions .'' " Heavens!" Jerry cries, as a horrid suspicion flashes over his mind, "The cholera! The cholera! Dearest, we will die together, locked in each other's arms!" and Jerry sought to embrace his lady love; but she was  scrouched up,  I believe the ladies term it, and as he had assumed the same globular position, approximation  could not be</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-188"/>
      <p> effected, and death had acquired another pang, from their having to meet him separate.</p>
      <p> Fortunately for them, the Major had got his sleep out some hours before, and, becoming anxious at their prolonged stay, set out to seek them. As the garden was a quiet, secluded place, he thought them most likely to be there, and there he found them, labouring under the influence, not so much of love as—the truth must out— an overdose of grapes: and you know how they affect the system.</p>
      <p> A boy was despatched post haste after me. Fortunately I was at home, and quickly reached the spot. I reached the house, and was introduced immediately to the apartment where both the patients lay. A glance at their condition and position explained the cause fully of their disease. A hearty emetic effected a cure ; and the first child of Jerry and Mary Wilson was distinctly marked on the left shoulder with a bunch of grapes.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-189"/>
      <p> HOW TO CURE FITS.</p>
      <p> Not  none of the least difficult problems, in the practice of medicine, is the distinguishing bet\Veen cases of real disease, and those that are feigned. It is a great stumbling block in the path of young practitioners, and even the old members of the fraternity find a few chips of it in their way occasionally. To such a degree may the art of dissimulation be carried, that nothing but the eye of suspicion and blind presentiment will lead us to detect the imposition. I have known a case of simulated disease, after deceiving some of the first physicians in the South, and withstanding almost every species of treatment, to be cured by an energetic, liberal administration of the negro-whip. But this is a remedy that fearful humanity will not allow us to use, and consequently I never resort to it, but use equally as effective, but uninjurious means.</p>
      <p> Shortly after I commenced practice, I was sent for in a great hurry to see a case of fits in the person of a negro wench, belonging to a plantation a few miles from where I was located. The fit was over when I reached the place, and I found the patient resting very composedly and showing no evidence of present or past disease ; but the testimony of her master went to show that she had had one of the worst fits he had ever seen, and he ought to know something about fits, as he had lived several years in Arkansas, where the doctors invariably throw every case into fits as preliminary to a cure.</p>
      <p> I made a prescription suitable to his description, and returned home, only to be sent for in greater haste the</p>
      <p> (189)</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-190"/>
      <p> next day, and so on every day for a week, the fits seeming to increase in intensity under my treatment. I remarked, as a peculiarity of her case, that on Sundays, and when rain prevented her being put out to work, she escaped the attack ; but hardly could the hoe-handle salute her palm in the cotton-field, before she would be screeching, yelping, and struggling like a friend of mine, who, camping out, made his pillow of a fallen, but still tenanted hornets' nest.</p>
      <p> I became desperate ; the owner was becoming tired of sending for me, and my reputation was suflfering, for the patient was getting worse. I examined her again thoroughly, but nothing could I find in her digestive, arterial, nervous, muscular, or osseous systems, to indicate disease. I shaved all the wool oflf her head to feel for depressed skull-bones, and commencing the Materia Me-dica at Acetic Acid, administered through to Zingiber, concluding the course by knocking her senseless with a galvanic battery; but she stood fits, treatment, and everything else without change, and not till a strong impression rested on my mind that she was feigning, did a difl[erent course of treatment suggest itself to me. The plantation lay on both sides of a deep bayou, the link of connexion a high wooden bridge. I happened in one day at the house, when I perceived four negroes approaching the bridge from the opposite field, bearing some object in a blanket.</p>
      <p> Finding, on inquiry, that my patient had that morning started to work in that part of the plantation, I readily surmised that the blanket aforesaid contained my case of fits.</p>
      <p> Asking the overseer to accompany me, we advanced to meet the negroes, who seemed to have great difficulty in keeping the object in the blanket • we met them just as</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-191"/>
      <p> HOW   TO   CURE   FITS.</p>
      <p> 191</p>
      <p> they reached the centre of the bridge, the water underneath being some eight or ten feet deep.</p>
      <p> " Who have you got there ?" I asked.</p>
      <p> " Hannah, sir, has got another of her fits," replied one of the negroes.</p>
      <p> " Put her down on the bridge and let me examine her." It was done ; it required the united strength of the four negroes to hold her still whilst I made the necessary examination, the result of which confirmed my impression that she was simulating. I thundered almost in her ears, but she gave no answer, and I determined to put in execution my new plan of treatment.</p>
      <p> " Pick her up and throw her in the bayou," I said, very clearly and precisely.</p>
      <p> Knowing I rarely said what I did not mean, the negroes yet hesitated somewhat at the singular command, afraid either to obey or refuse.</p>
      <p> " Throw her in !" I yelled, giving a thundering stamp on the bridge.</p>
      <p> No longer in doubt, the negroes picked up the blanket, and giving it a few preliminary swings, to acquire momentum, were about to cast away, when, with a loud yell, the case of fits burst from their hold and made tracks for the cotton-field. I am pretty fleet myself, as were the negroes, but that  poor diseased invalid  beat us all, and had hoed considerably on a row before we reached her. A liberal flagellation completed the cure, and she has never been troubled with fits since!</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-192"/>
      <p> A STRUGGLE FOR LIFE.</p>
      <p> It  was the spring of 183-, the water from the Mississippi had commenced overflowing the low swamps, and rendering travelling on horseback very disagreeable. The water had got to that troublesome height, when it was rather too high for a horse, and not high enough for a canoe or skiff to pass easily over the submerged grounds.</p>
      <p> I was sitting out under my favourite oak, congratulating myself that I had no travelling to do just then,—it was very healthy—when my joy was suddenly nipped in the bud by a loud hallo from the opposite side of the bayou. Looking over, and answering the hail, I discerned first a mule, and then something which so closely resembled an ape or an ourang outang, that I was in doubt whether the voice had proceeded from it, until a repetition of the hail, this time coming unmistakeably from it, assured me that it was a human.</p>
      <p> " Massa doctor at home .'"' yelled the voice.</p>
      <p> " Yes, I am the doctor ; what do you want.?"</p>
      <p> " Massa sent me with a letter to you."</p>
      <p> Jumping in the skiff, a few vigorous strokes sent me to the opposite shore, where the singular being awaited my coming.</p>
      <p> He was a negro dwarf of the most frightful appearance ; his diminutive body was garnished with legs and arms of enormously disproportionate length ; his face was hideous: a pair of tushes projected from either side of a double hare-lip ; and taking him altogether, he was the nearest resemblance to the ourang outang mixed with the devil,</p>
      <p> (192)</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-193"/>
      <p> A   STRUGGLE   FOR  LIFE.</p>
      <p> 193</p>
      <p> that human eyes ever dwelt upon.    I could not look at him without feeling disgust.</p>
      <p> " Massa Bill sent me with a letter," was his reply to ray asking him his business.</p>
      <p> Opening it, I found a summons to see a patient, the mother of a man named Disney, living some twenty miles distant by the usual road. It was in no good humour that I told the dwarf to wait until I could swim my horse over, and I would-accompany him.</p>
      <p> By the time I had concluded my preparations, and put a large bottle of brandy in my pocket, my steed was awaiting me upon the opposite shore.</p>
      <p> " Massa tole me to tell you ef you didn't mine swimming a little you had better kum de nere way."</p>
      <p> " Do you have to swim much ?"</p>
      <p> '&lt; Oh no, massa, onely swim Plurisy Lake, and wade de back water a few mile, you'll save haf de way at leste."</p>
      <p> I looked at the sun. It was only about two hours high, and the roads were in such miserable condition that six miles an hour would be making fine speed, so I determined to go the near way, and swim "Pleurisy slough."</p>
      <p> " You are certain you know the road, boy?"</p>
      <p> " Oh, yes, massa, me know um ebery inch ob de groun'; hunted possum an' coon ober him many a night. Massa, you ain't got any 'baccy, is you?"</p>
      <p> &lt;' There's a chaw—and here's a drink of brandy.    I'll</p>
      <p> ^e you another if you piL pounding if you get lost."</p>
      <p> " Dank you, Massa, urn's good. No fere I lose you, know ebery inch of de groun'."</p>
      <p> I had poured him out a dram, not considering his diminutive stature, sufficient to unsettle the nerves of a stout man, but he drank it off with great apparent relish; and 16</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-194"/>
      <p> by this time, everything being ready, we commenced ploughing our way through the muddy roads.</p>
      <p> We made but slow progress. I would dash on, and then have to wait for the dwarf, who, belabouring his mule with a cudgel almost as large as himself, strove in vain to keep up.</p>
      <p> The road was directly down the bayou, for some miles. There were few settlers on it then, and the extent of their clearing consisted of a corn-patch. They were the pre-emptioners or squatters; men who settled upon government land before its survey, and awaited the incoming of planters with several negroes to buy their claims, themselves to be bought out by more affluent emigrants. To one of the first-mentioned class—the pre-emptioners—my visit was directed, or rather to his mother, who occupied an intermediate grade between the squatter and the small planter, inasmuch as she possessed one negro, the delectable morsel for whom I was waiting every few hundred yards.</p>
      <p> It wanted but an hour to sundown when we reached the place where it was optional with me, either to go the longer route by the bayou, or save several miles by cutting across the bend of the stream, having, however, to swim " Pleurisy slough" if I did so.</p>
      <p> The path across was quite, obscure, and it would be dark by the time we crossed ; but the negro declared he knew every inch of the way, and as saving distance was a serious consideration, I determined to try it and " Pleurisy slough."</p>
      <p> Taking a drink to warm me, for the dew that had commenced to fall was quite chilling, I gave one to the negro, not noticing the wild sparkle of his eye or the exhilaration of his manner.</p>
      <p> We pressed on eagerly, I ahead as long as the path</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-195"/>
      <p> lasted; but it giving out at the edge of the back water, it became necessary for the negro to precede and pilot the way.</p>
      <p> I followed him mechanically for some distance, relying on his intimate knowledge of the swamp, our steeds making but slow progress through the mud and water.</p>
      <p> When we entered the swamp I had remarked that the sun was in our faces; and great was my astonishment, when we had travelled some time, on glancing my eye upwards to see if it had left the tree-tops, to perceive its last beams directly at my back, the very reverse of what it should have been. Thinking perhaps that it was some optical illusion, I consulted the moss on the trees, and its indication was that we were taking the back track. I addressed the negro very sharply for having misled me, when, instead of excusing himself, he turned on me his hideous countenance and chuckled the low laugh of drunkenness. I saw that I had given him too much brandy for his weak brain, and that he was too far gone to be of any assistance to me in finding the way.</p>
      <p> Mine was a pleasant situation truly. To return home would be as bad as to endeavour to go on ; it would be night at any rate before I could get out of the swamp ; and after it fell, as there was no moon, it would be dangerous to travel, as the whole country was full of lakes and sloughs, and we might be precipitated suddenly into one of them, losing our animals if not being drowned ourselves.</p>
      <p> It was evident that I would have to pass the night in the swamp, my only companion the drunken dwarf. I had nothing to eat, and no weapons to protect myself if assailed by wild beasts; but the swamp was high enough to preclude the attack of anything but an alliga-</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-196"/>
      <p> tor, and their bellow was resounding in too close proximity to be agreeable.</p>
      <p> Fortunately, being a cigar-smoker, I had a box of matches in my pocket, so I would have a fire at least. My next care was to find a ridge sufficiently above the water to furnish a dry place for building a fire and camp. After considerable search, just at night-fall the welcome prospect of a cane ridge above the overflow met my gaze ; hurrying up the negro, who by this time was maudlin drunk, I reached the cane, and forcing my way with considerable difficulty through it until I got out of the reach of the water, dismounted, and tying my horse, took the negro down and performed the same office for his mule.</p>
      <p> My next care was to gather materials for a fire before impenetrable darkness closed over the swamp ; fortunately for me, a fallen oak presented itself not ten steps from where I stood. To have a cheerful blazing fire was the work of a few minutes. Breaking off sufficient cane-tops to last the steeds till morning, I stripped my horse—the mule had nothing on but a bridle—and with the saddle and cane-leaves made me a couch that a monarch, had he been as tired as I was, would have found no fault with. As the negro was perfectly helpless, and nearly naked, I gave him my saddle blanket, and making him a bed at a respectful distance, bade him go to sleep.</p>
      <p> Replenishing the fire with sufficient fuel to last till morning, I lit a cigar, and throwing myself down upon my fragrant couch, gave myself up to reflections upon the peculiarity of my situation. Had it been a voluntary bivouac with a set of chosen companions, it would not have awakened half the interest in my mind that it did, for the attending circumstances imparted to it much of the romantic.</p>
      <p> There, far from human habitation, my only companion</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-197"/>
      <p> a hideous dwarf, surroun:led with water, the night drape? ried darkly around, I lay, the cane-leaves for my bed, the saddle for my pillow ; the huge fire lighting up the darkness for a space around, and giving natural objects a strange, distorted appearance, bringing the two steeds into high relief against the dark background of waving cane, which nodded over, discoursing a wild, peculiar melody of its own. Occasionally a loud explosion would be heard as the fire communicated with a green reed ; the wild hoot of an owl was heard, and directly I almost felt the sweep of his wings as he went sailing by, and alighted upon an old tree just where the light sank mingling with the darkness. I followed him with my eye, and as he settled himself, he turned his gaze towards me ; I moved one of the logs, and his huge eyes fairly glistened with light, as the flames shot up with increased vigour; the swamp moss was flowing around him in long, tangled masses, and as a more vivid gleam uprose, I gazed and started involuntarily. Had I not known it was an owl surrounded with moss that sat upon that stricken tree, I would have sworn it was the form of an old man, clad in a sombre flowing mantle, his arm raised in an attitude of warning, that I gazed upon. A cane exploding, startled the owl, and with a loud '&lt; tu whit, tu -whoo," he went sailing away in the darkness. The unmelodious bellow of the alligator, and the jarring cry of the heron, arose from a lake on the opposite side of the cane ; w'hilst the voices of a myriad of frogs, and the many undistinguish-able sounds of the swamp, made the night vocal with discordancy.</p>
      <p> My cigar being by this time exhausted, I took the bottle from my pocket, and taking a hearty drink to keep the night air from  chilling me  when asleep, was about to restore it to its place, and commend myself to slumber, 16*</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-198"/>
      <p> when, glancing at the dwarf, I saw his eyes fixed upon n.e with a demoniac expression that I shall never forget.</p>
      <p> " Give me a dram," he said very abruptly, not prefacing the request by those deferential words never omitted by the slave when in his proper mind.</p>
      <p> " No, sir, you have already taken too much; I will give you no more," I replied.</p>
      <p> " Give me a dram," he again said, more fiercely than before.</p>
      <p> Breaking off a cane, I told him that if he spoke to me in that manner again I would give him a severe flogging.</p>
      <p> But to my surprise he retorted, '&lt; D—n you, white man, I will kill you ef you don't give me more brandy!" his eyes flashing and sparkling with electric light.</p>
      <p> I rose to correct him, but a comparison of my well developed frame with his stunted deformed proportions, and the reflection that his drunkenness was attributable to my giving him the brandy, deterred me.</p>
      <p> &lt;' I will kill you," he again screamed, his fangs clashing, and the foam flying from his mouth, his long arms extended as if to clutch me, and the fingers quivering nervously.</p>
      <p> I took a hasty glance of my condition. I was lost in the midst of the swamp, an unknown watery expanse surrounding me; remote from any possible assistance ; the swamps were rapidly filling with water, and if we did not get out to-morrow or next day, we would in all probability be starved or drowned ; the negro was my only dependence, to pilot me to the settlements, and he was threatening my life if I did not give him more brandy; should I do it or not? Judging from the eflfects of the two drinks I had given him, if he got possession of the bottle it might destroy him, or at least render him incapable of travelling, until  starvation  and exposure would</p>

      <p> A   STRUGGLE   FOR  LIFE.</p>
      <p> 199</p>
      <p> destroy us. My mind was resolved upon that subject; I would give him no more. There was no alternative, I would have to stand his assault; considering I was three times his size, a fearful adventure, truly, thought I, not doubting a moment but that my greater size would give me proportionate strength ; I must not hurt him, but will tie him until he recovers.</p>
      <p> The dw^arf, now aroused to maniacal fury by the per-sistance in my refusal, slowly approached me to carry his threat into execution. The idea of such a diminutive object destroying w^ithout weapons a man of my size, presented something ludicrous, and I laughingly awaited his attack, ready to tie his hands before he could bite or scratch me.    Wofully I underrated his powers!</p>
      <p> With a yell like a wild beast's, he precipitated himself upon me; evading my blow, he clutched with his long fingers at my throat, burying his talons in my flesh, and writhing his little body around mine, strove to bear me to earth.</p>
      <p> I summoned my whole strength, and endeavoured to shake him off; but, possessing the proverbial power of the dwarf, increased by his drunken mania to an immense degree, I found all my efforts unavailing, and, oh God! horrors of horrors, what awful anguish was mine, when I found him bearing me slowly to earth, and his piercing talons buried in my throat, cutting off ray breath! My eyes met his with a more horrid gleam than that he glared upon me: his w'as the fire of brutal nature, aroused by desire to intense malignancy; and mine the gaze of despair and death. Closer and firmer his gripe closed upon my throat, barring out the sweet life's breath. I strove to shriek for help, but could not. How shall I describe the racking agony that tortured me ? A mountain, heavier than  any earth's bosom  holds,  was pressing upon my</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-200"/>
      <p> breast, slowly crushing me to fragments. All kinds of colours first floated before my eyes, and then everything wore a settled, intensely fiery red. I felt my jaw slowly dropping, and my tongue protruding, till it rested on the hellish fangs that encircled my throat. I could hear distinctly every pulsation of even the minutest artery in my frame. Its wild singing was in my ears like the ocean wave playing over the shell-clad shore. I remember it all perfectly, for the mind, through all this awful struggle, still remained full of thought and clearness. Closer grew the gripe of those talons around my throat, and I knew that I could live but a few moments more. I did not pray. I did not commend my soul to God. I had not a fear of death. But oh! awful were my thoughts at dying in such a way—suffocated by a hellish negro in the midst of the noisome swamp, my flesh to be devoured by the carrion crow, my bones to whiten where they lay for long years, and then startle the settler, when civilization had strode into the wilderness, and the cane that would conceal my bones would be falling before the knife of the cane-cutter. I ceased to breathe. I was dead. I had suffered the last pangs of that awful hour, and either it was the soul not yet resigned to leave its human tenement, or else immortal mind triumphing over death, but I still retained the sentient principle within my corpse. I remember distinctly when the demon relaxed his clutch, and shaking me to see if I were really dead, broke into a hellish laugh. I remember distinctly when tearing the bottle from me, he pulled my limber body off my couch, and stretched himself upon it. And what were my thoughts ? I was dead, yet am living now. Ay, dead as human ever becomes. My lungs had ceased to play; my heart was still; my muscles were inactive; even my skin had the dead clammy touch.    Had men been there, they would have placed me</p>

      <p> in a coffin, and buried me deep in the ground, and the worm would have eaten me, and the death-rats made nests in my heart, and what was lately a strong man Avould have become a loathsome mass. But still in that coffin amidst those writhing worms, would have been the immortal mind, and still would it have thought and pondered on till the last day was come. For such is the course of soul and death, as my interpretation has it. I was dead, all but my mind, and that still thought on as vividly, as ramblingly, as during life. My body lay dead in that murderer's swamp, my mind roamed far away in thought, reviewing my carnal life. I stood, as when a boy, by my mother's grave. The tall grass was waving over it, the green sod smiled at my feet. '&lt; Mother," I whispered, " your child is weary—the world looks harsh upon him—coldness comes from those who should shelter the orphan. Mother, open your large black eyes and smile upon your child." Again, I stood upon the steamer, a childish fugitive, giving a last look upon my fleeing home, and mingling my tears with the foaming wave beneath. I dragged my exhausted frame through the cotton-fields of the south. My back was wearied with stooping—we were picking the first opening—and as dreams of future distinction would break upon my soul, the strap of the cotton-sack, galling my shoulder, recalled me to myself. All the phases of my life were repeated, until they ended where I lay dead!—dead as mortal ever becomes. I thought. What will my friends say when they hear that on a visit to the sick, I disappeared in the swamp, and was never heard of more ?—drowned or starved to death.'' Will they weep for me ? for me ?—Not many, I ween, will be the tears that will be shed for me. Then, after the lapse of long years, my bones will be found. I wonder who will get my skull ?    Perhaps an humble doctor like</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-202"/>
      <p> myself, who, meditating upon it, will not think that it holds the mind of a creature of his own ambition—his own lofty instincts. He will deem it but an empty skull, and little dream that it held a sentient principle. But I know that the mind will still t-enant it. Ha, ha! how that foul ape is gurgling his blood-bought pleasure. I would move if I could, and wrench the bottle from him; but mine is thought, not action. Hark! there is a storm arising. I hear with my ear, that is pressed on the earth, the thunder of the hurricane. How the trees crash beneath it! Will it prostrate those above me? Hark! what awful thunder! Ah me ! what fierce pang is that piercing my very vitals? There is a glimmering of light before my eyes. Can it be that I the dead am being restored to human life ? Another thunder peal! 'tis the second stroke of my heart— my blood is red-hot—it comes with fire through my veins —the earth quakes—the mountain is rolling off my chest— I live!—I breathe!—I see !—I hear!—Where am I ? Who brought me here ? I hear other sounds, but cannot my own voice. Where am I ? Ah ! I remember the dwarf strangled me. Hark! where is he ? Is that the sunbeam playing over the trees ? What noisome odour like consuming flesh is that which poisons the gale ? Great God ! can that disfigured half-consumed mass be my evil genius?" I rose up, and staggering, fell again; my strength was nearly gone. I lay until I thought myself sufficiently recruited to stand, and then got up and surveyed the scene. The animals were tied as I left them, and w^ere eating their cane unconcernedly; but fearfully my well-nigh murderer had paid for his crime, and awful was the retribution. Maddened by the spirits, he had rushed into the flames, and, in the charred and loathsome mass, nothing of the human remained; he had died the murderer's death and been buried in his grave,—a tomb of fire.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-203"/>
      <p> To remain longer in the horrid place was impossible ; my throat pained me excessively where the talons had penetrated the flesh, and I could not speak above a whisper. I turned the mule loose, thinking that it would return home, and conduct me out of the swamp. I was not incorrect in my supposition; the creature led me to its owner's cabin. The patient had died during the night.</p>
      <p> My account of the dwarf's attack did not surprise the family; he had once, when in a similar condition, made an attack upon his mistress, and would have strangled her had assistance not been near.</p>
      <p> His bones were left to bleach where they lay. I would not for the universe have looked again upon the place; and his mistress being dead, there were none to care for giving him the rites of sepulture.</p>

      <p> r-fJ</p>
      <p> marshals, being all those created by him— and therefore these pages have a completeness about them which no other work of a similar design possesses.</p>
      <p> The style is clear and comprehensive, and the book may be relied upon for historical accuracy, as the materials have been drawn from sources the most authentic. The Conversations of Napoleon, with Mon-tholon, Gourgaud, Las Cases and Dr. O'-Meara have all been consulted as the true basis upon which the lives of Napoleon and his commanders under him should be founded.</p>
      <p> "The article on Napoleon, which occupies the greater part o( the first volume, is written in a clear and forcible style and displays marked ability in the author. Particular attention has been paid to the early portion of Napoleon's life, which other writers have hurriedly dispatched as though they were impatient to arrive at the opening glories of his great career."— N. Y. Mirror.</p>
      <p> "The lives of the Marshals and their Chief, the military paladins of the gorgeous modern romance of the 'Empire,' are given with historic accuracy and without exaggeration of fact, style or language."—£ai-timore Patriot.</p>
      <p> " We have long been convinced that the character of Napoleon would never receive 'even handed justice' until some impartial and intelligent American should undertake the task of weighing his merits and demerits. In the present volume this has been done with great judgment. We do not know the author of the paper on Napoleon, but whoever he may be, allow us to say to him that he has executed his duty  better titan any predecessor."— Evening Bulletin.</p>
      <p> " The style of this work i? worthy of commendation—plain, pleasing and narrative, the proper style of history and biography in which the reader does not seek fancy sketches, and dashing vivid pictures, but what the work professes to contain, biographies.

The style is plain and graphic, and the reader feels that he is perusing true history rather than the ramblings of a romantic mind."—Z,arfi/'s  Book.</p>
      <p> "The result of these joint labors is a series of narratives, in which the events succeed each other so rapidly, and are of so marvelous a cast, as to require only the method in arrangement and the good taste in description which they have received from the hands of their authors. The inflated and the Ossianic have been happily avoided."— Colonization Herald.</p>
      <p> "Their historical accuracy is unimpeachable, and many of them (the biographies) are stamped with originality of thought and opinion. The engravings are numereus and very hne. The book is well printed on fine white paper, and substantially bound. It deserves a place in all family and school libraries."— Bulletin.</p>

      <p> We  hail these beautiful volumes with undisguised delight. They supply, in a dignified and comprehensive form, valuable information, which will be sought with avidity, not only by the American public, but by the world at large. The want of a work of  positive authority  on this subject has long been felt and deplored. The enterprise and good taste of Messrs. Carey and Hart have given us two handsome and reliable volumes, betraying industry and talent, and replete with facts of the deepest interest. There is no idle romancing—no school-boy attempts at rhetorical display; on the contrary, the work is written in a clear, unaffected, business-like, yet beautiful manner. The authors had the good sense to think that the stirring events of "the times that tried men's souls," needed no embellishment. It is a complete, impartial, and well ■written history of the American Revolution, and, at the same time, a faithful biography of the most distinguished actors in that great struggle, whose memories are enshrined in our hearts. The typographical execution of the work is excellent, and the sixteen portraits on steel are remarkably well done. The first volume is embellished with a life-like portrait of Washington mounted on his charger, from Sully's picture,  "Quelling t/ie Whisky Riots."  This is, we believe, the first engraving taken from it. There are biographies of  eighty-eight Generals,  beginning with "the Father of his country," and closing with General Maxwell. To accomplish this task, we are assured that "the accessible published and unpublished memoirs, correspondence, and other materials relating to the period, have been carefully examined and faithfully reflected." We earnestly commend this work. It will be found an unerring record of the most interesting portion of our history.— The City Item.</p>
      <p> This work differs from Mr. Headley's, having nearly the same title, in many important particulars; and  as an historical book is much superior. — N. Y. Co7?i. Advertiser.</p>
      <p> Certainly the most comprehensive and individualized work that has ever been published on the subject—each member of the great  dratnatis personm  of the Revolutionary tragedy, standing out in bold and "sculptured" relief, on his own glorious d'^Kla —Saturday Courier.</p>
      <p> This work is a very different affair from the flashy and superficial book of the Rev. J. T. Headley, entitled "Washington and his   Generals."    It appears  without   the</p>
      <p> J name of any author, because it is the joint production of many of the most eminent writers in the country, resident in various states in the Union, and having, from the circumstance, access to original materials in private hands, and to public archives not accessible to any one individual without long journey and much consumption of tiine. The result, however, is a complete and authentic work, embracing biographical notices of every one of tlie Revolutionary Generals. The amount of I'resh and original matter thus brought together in these moderate-sized volumes, is not less surprising than it is gratifying to the historical reader. This will become a standard book of reference, and will maintain its place in libraries long after the present generation shall have enjoyed the gratification of perusing its interesting pages, exhibiting in a lively style the personal adventures and private characters of the sturdy defenders of American Independence.— ScotVs Weekly Newspaper.</p>
      <p> The author's name is not given, and from what we have read, we presume that various pens have been employed in these interesting biographies. This is no disadvantage, but, on the contrary, a decided benefit, tor it insures greater accuracy than could be looked for in such a series of biographies written by one person in a few months. The volumes are published in a very handsome style. The first sixty pages are occupied with the biography of Washington, which is written with force and elegance, and illustrated by an original view of the character of that great man. * * * The number of the biographies in these volumes is much greater than that of Mr. Headley's work. There are eighty-eight distinct subjects.— N. Y. Mirror.</p>
      <p> We have read a number of the articles, ; find them to be written with ability, and to ! possess a deep interest. The author has manifested excellent judgment in avoiding all ambitious attempts at what is styled fine writing;  but gives a connected recital of the important events in the lives of his heroes. The work will be highly interesting and valuable to all readers—particularly so to youth, who are always attracted by biographies. If a father wishes to present to his sons noble instances of uncor-rupted and incorruptible patriotism, lethira place this work in their hands. It should have a place in every American library, and is among the most valuable books of the season.— Bcdtimore American.</p>

They consist of corrrspondeiice, now first given to the world, of Washington, the elder Adams, Ames, John Marshall, Rufus King, Timothy Pickering, Wolcott, &amp;e. There are thirty-seven original letters from Alexander Hamilton, many of ihemof the highest interest; one in which the writer with keen sagacity and all the splendor of his eloquence, gives a character of Mr. Burr upon which his own fate was destined to put the seal of truth, is read now with singular emotions. Mr. Gibbs has performed his task extremely well. His preface is modest and dignified. The passages of narrative by which the letters are connected are accurate, judicious and agreeable; they illustrate, and do not overlay the principal material of the work."— North American.</p>
      <p> "Here we meet, illustrated in something like forty important letters, the blazing intelligence, the practical sagacity, the heroic generosity, the various genius, which have made Hamilton the name of statesmanship and greatness, rather than the name of a man. Here we have the piercing judgment of John Marshall, unsusceptible of error, whose capacity to see the truth was equalled only by his power of compelling others to receive it; in the light of whose logic opinions appeared to assume the nature of facts, and truth acquires the palpableness of a material reality; the bluntness, force and probity of Pickering; the sterling excellences of Wolcott himself, who had no artifices and no concealments, because his strength was too great to require them, and his purposes too pure to admit them; and sounding as an understrain through the whole, the prophet tones of Ames."—  U.

Some of the sketches in this volume are spirited and cleverly written, and they are all lively and full of animal spirits; but they are too brief to contain a development of character. The best sketch is the story of ' Old Sugar,' which is illustrated by an exceedingly fine drawing by Darley.

In order to render the publication cheap, and therefore attainable by all our public and social libraries, as well as by those general readers who study economy, the seventeen octavo volumes have been comprised in three volumes, imperial octavo. Being printed from the most accurate as well as complete English edition, and carefully revised, the American edition ■will possess greater advantages for the critical scholar as well as the general reader. In typography, paper and binding, it will be recognized as a brilliant specimen of] the products of the American book trade.</p>
      <p> "We may safely affirm, that, by giving the Inductive Philosophy to the world, Lord Bacon .has proved one of its most signal benefactors, and has largely done his part towards promoting the final triumph of all truth, whether natural, or moral and intellectual, over all error; and towards bringing on that glorious crisis, destined, we doubt not, one day to arrive, when, according to the allegorical representation of that great poet, who was not only the Admirer of Bacon, but in some respects his kindred genius— Truth,  though ' hewn like the mangled body of Osiris, into a thousand pieces, and scattered to the four winds, shall be gathered limb to limb, and moulded, with every joint and inember, into an immortal feature of loveliness and perfection.' "</p>
      <p> "We are more gratified than we can find words to express, to find a publishing house in this country, putting forth a publication like the Complete Works of Lord Bacon, in a form at once compact, elegant and economical."—£ro«/i£7-  Jonathan.</p>

      <p> A  NEW EDITION  OF</p>
      <p> THE WAVERLEY NOVELS,</p>
      <p> By sir  WALTER SCOTT,</p>
      <p> With all the Author^s latest Notes and Additions, Cojnplete, without the slightest Abridgment. In Five Royal 8vo. volumes, upwards of 850 Pages in each volume.</p>
      <p> [CONTENTS.</p>

Anne of Gierslein, Count Robert of Paris, Castle Dangerous, The Surgeon's Daughter.</p>
      <p> The object of the publishers in thus reducing the price of the Waverley Novels, is to endeavor to give them a greatly extended circulation, and tliey have, therefore, put them at a price which brings them</p>
      <p> iihin the reach of every family in the country. There is  now  no fireside that need be without a set of the most charming works of fiction ever issued from the press : for there is no one that can't afford two dollars and a half—TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF for twenty-five of Sir Walter Scott's Novels! ten cents for a complete  Novel ! !   ten  cents for " Ivanhoe,"</p>
      <p> hich was originally published at a guinea</p>
      <p> id a half! ! 1    It seems impossible, and yet</p>
      <p> is true. In no other way can the same amount of amusement and instruction be obtained for ten times the money, for the Waverley Novels alone form a Library.</p>
      <p> The publishers wish it to be distinctly understood, that, while the price is so greatly reduced the work is in no way abridged,</p>
      <p> but  is CAREFULLY  PRINTED   FROM, AND CONTAINS EVERY WORD IN THE LAST EDINBURGH</p>
      <p> Edition,  in forty-eight volumes, which sells for seventy-two dollars.</p>
      <p> Now is the time to buy !    Such an opportunity may never again occur.   Let every one, then, who wants the   Waverley Novels ''or two dollars and a half, now purchase,  fol '"the publishers do not find the sale greatly creased,  by  the  immense  reduction  in lice,  they will  resume  the old price of twenty-five cents for each Novel, which 'US  considered wonderfully cheap.</p>

      <p> " Almost every thing he has written is so iiharacteristii: that it would be difficult to attribute it to any otlier man. The marked individual features and the rare combination of power displayed in his works, give them a fascination unconnected with the subject of which he treatsor the general correctness of his views. He sometimes hits the mark in the white, he sometimes misses It altogether, for he by no means confines his pen to theories to which he is calculated to do justice; but whether he hits or misses, he is always  sparkling  and delightful. The charm of his writings is somewhat similar to Dial of Montaigne or Charles Lamb."— North American Review,</p>

      <p> From a very able article in the North; British Review we extract the following :</p>
      <p> "It is a book not to be read only—but; studied—it is a vast repository; or rather a system or institute, embracing the whole circle  of  letters—if we except the exact | sciences—and contains within itself, nolin ' a desultory form, but in a well digested scheme, more original conceptions, bold and fearless speculation and just reasoning on all kinds and varieties of subjects than are to be found in any English writer with whom we are acquainted within the pre-; sent or the last generation. * * * His choice of words is unbounded and his felicity of expression, to the most impalpable shade of discrimination, almost miraculous. Playfu., lively, and full of illustration, no ! subject is so dull or so dry that he cannot; invest it with interest, and none so trifling that it cannot acquire dignity or elegance from his pencil. Independently however, of mere style and apart Iroin the great variety of subjects embraced by his pen, the distinguishing feature of his writings, and that in which he excels his cotempo-rary reviewers, is the deep vein of practical; thought which runs throughout ihera all."   ;</p>

      <p> " There is nothing mechanical about her; all is buoyant, overflowing, irrepressible vivacity, like the bubbling up of a natural fountain. In her almost childish playfulness, she reminds us of that exquisite crea/-tion of Fouque, Undine, who knew no law but that of her own waywardness. The great charm of her poetry is its unaffected simplicity. It is the transparent simplicity of truth, reflecting the feeling of the moment like a mirror."— Rev. Dr. Davidson.</p>
      <p> " In all the poems of Mrs. Osgood, we find occasion to admire the author as well as the works. Her spontaneous and instinctive effusions appear, in a higher degree than any others in our literature, to combine the rarest and highest capacities in art with the sinccrest and deepest sentiments and the noblest aspirations. They would convince us, if the beauty of her life were otherwise unknown, that Sirs. Osgood is one of the loveliest characters in the histories of literature or society."— Pennsylvania Inquirer and Courier.</p>
      <p> "The position of Mrs. Osgood, as a graceful and womanly poetesi!, is fixed, and will be enduring. To taste of faultless delicacy, a remarkable command of poetical language, great variety of cadence, and a most musical versification, she has added recently the highest qualities of inspiration, imagination, and passion, in a degree rarely equalled in the productions of women. . . . The reputation which Mrs. Osgood enjoys, as one of the most amiable, true-hearted, and brilliant ladies in American society, will add to the good fortune of a book, the intrinsic excellence and beauty of which will secure for it a place among the standard creations of female ga« ■Di\xa."—Home Journal,</p>
