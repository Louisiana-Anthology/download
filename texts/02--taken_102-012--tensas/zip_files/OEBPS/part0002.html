      <p> It  was my intention, after graduating, to return and locate myself in the small town where I had studied my profession ; but " circumstances," which exerted such a powerful influence over a late unsuccessful aspirant for political honours, exercised a like power upon me.</p>
      <p> The death of my preceptor, whilst I was absent attending my last course of lectures, left a vacancy in the profession at home, which was speedily filled, as far as numbers went, by a horde of new-comers. So I found I would have to encounter, if I settled there, a greater competition, without the assistance I calculated deriving from him, than my slender means and already embarrassed finances qualified me to meet. Besides, locating among those who had known me from boyhood, the probation I would have to undergo before I secured their full confidence would be more severe, and of much longer duration, than if I had landed in their midst a perfect stranger. The transition from the boy to the man, and from the mischievous student to the grave, serious physician, is so gradual and imperceptible, that our old and intimate acquaintances do not realize it; and when they should know us as doctor they still give us our youthful appellatives, and regard us as boys. When I landed at home, proud of my new-fledged honours and " sheepskin" as a youi.g mother of her first babe, I had, on meeting my former acquaintances, to fling my memory back to the eventful examining period to convince myself that I was really a '&lt; doctor of medicine ;" for every one, even down to the</p>

      <p> children, called me "Madison" as before, and none of them seemed a moment to consider that a title, the acquisition of which had cost—both mental and pecuniary—as much as mine, should be occasionally used.</p>
      <p> In despite of these disadvantageous circumstances, and my own disinclination, it was the opinion of some few friends, to whom I deferred greatly, that I had bettdl" locate there ; so procuring an office, and having my name and title emblazoned on a sheet of tin, which I securely fastened to the door, I shook off gaiety and the dust of ray feet at the lintel, and with a ponderous tome, and anatomically painted skull before me, took my seat at my small green baize coloured table, to aw^ait cases and patients.</p>
      <p> I recollect distinctly, as no doubt every young professional man does in his own case, my sensations upon the first few days succeeding the setting of my trap, when I was constantly upon the look-out for some victim approaching the bait.</p>
      <p> I tried to address myself to the volume before me, but my busy imagination had turned architect, and was erecting air-built tenements of the most magnificent and gorgeous nature.</p>
      <p> " Calls" innumerable flitted through my brain. Fevers, from simple intermittents to congestive, were awaiting my curative dispensations ; whilst a trumpeter stood ready to peal forth my triumphs to the world, and a quiet, unobtrusive grave, to cover the unsuccessful.</p>
      <p> I had just performed a surgical operation, never before attempted, of the most difficult and dangerous character, upon the "President," with the happiest results. The medical world was ringing with my name; and even the trading community, partaking of the general enthusiasm, mingled me in their thoughts, and spoke of my wonderful scientific achievements in the same breath that told of the</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-104"/>
      <p> rise or  decline of stocks, and a slight improvement in tlie price of cotton. And the ladies, too—God bless them! that their approving smiles sow the seeds of ambition in many hearts; ay, even the soft, tender-lipped lady, made me a theme of conversation, when her daily allowance of characters had been torn to pieces, and scandal palled the tongue. Edinburgh and London were striving which should obtain my services, as professor in one of their world-renowned institutions; and the crown was moving from the brows of Esculapius to my own ; when—hark! &lt;''Tis the cathedral pealing my triumphs!" "Listen how the solemn chant comes pouring up the mysterious aisle!" Pshaw! "'tis the supper-bell;" ''a little negro ringing &lt; Jim along Josey.' "</p>
      <p> I wrapped my cloak around me as if to shut out all the world, and strode ofT moodily to my supper, mad at myself for having yielded to my fancy, and almost allowing it to lead me astray.</p>
      <p> One day passed without a call—six days died of marasmus, and never the first patient crossed the threshold of my office. I could see other physicians hurrying by, attending to their numerous calls; some of them as youthful as myself; but, happily for them, they had the impress of the exotic, whilst I was indigenous to the soil. I sat in my lonely office, and could hear, as the busy noises of the town died away, and night allowed care to come on the face, which, through the garish day, had striven to appear mirthful, the hurried step of the messenger from the sick ; but they never stopped at my door— but on, on by, till distance had eaten up their clanging tread. Mine is a temperament which, exalted to almost delirium one moment, sinks into proportionate depression the next; and even the short space of a week without employment made  me down-hearted, and  assailed  me</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-105"/>
      <p> with continual despondency. My debts, contracted through tlie long years I had devoted to my profession— for malicious tongues had estranged my preceptor almost from nie before his death, and determined me to repay him for all his pecuniary expenditures—knocked continually against the door of my honour, and often, as I heard the saw and hammer of the artisan ringing through the town, I almost cursed the mistaken kindness of my friends, which had made a professional man of me, and wished, like the mechanic, I could go forth and earn my sweet and honest bread by the hot sweat of my brow.</p>
      <p> By chance I learned that a good location for a young physician presented itself in the Louisiana swamps. To resolve to seek it, to communicate my resolution to my friends, to obtain the necessary letters of introduction, and take passage on a steamer bound for Vicksburg, where I would have to reship, was the work of a few hours.</p>
      <p> The contemplated location w^as a short distance in the interior of the parish of Madison, and my next destination</p>
      <p> after arriving at V would be Milliken's Bend, where</p>
      <p> I could obtain a horse and explore the country.</p>
      <p> Just at sunrise, a steamer of rather slender dimensions</p>
      <p> and shabby appearance, came creeping along to V .</p>
      <p> As it was the first upward-bound boat that had arrived, a crowd of passengers, who were there awaiting one, rushed on board to secure a passage, myself among the number. Ascertaining how long she intended remaining there, which was but a short time, I thought I would have time to go up town and purchase some articles which I required, and had nearly forgotten; I procured them, and heard, as I descended the levee, the boat ringing her last bell; hastening my steps, I jumped on board just as she was pushing out. On going up in the cabin, I found to my surprise that I was the  only passenger.    She had</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-106"/>
      <p> brought none to Vicksburg, and of all the crowd who rushed on there, none had remained save myself.</p>
      <p> There was a mystery about the thing that I could not fathom, and did not endeavour very hard to penetrate; for my future was a sufficiently impenetrable enigma to employ all my penetration. Attributing the absence of passengers to the poor accommodations that were visible, I gave myself no further thought about the matter, but taking my cigar, ascended to the hurricane-deck, and there seating myself, gazed abstractedly out upon the waters, and gave myself up to my reflections. They were of a mixed nature; joy and sorrow, pride and shame, struggling for the mastery through all my recollections, and making too many compromises with each other for a spirit that strove to be at peace with itself.</p>
      <p> There, in the same bold, impetuous torrent, coursed the majestic " Father of Waters," as it did ten long years ago, when the doctor, who was ascending it, seeking for a home amidst strangers—his heart care-worn and filled with anxiety, descended its current— a  scullion.</p>
      <p> My pride was gratified to think that I had risen as it were superior to my station and opportunities, and, from a scullion, had become a member of an honourable profession; and that, too, ere the beard had come on my face, or years twenty-one stamped me a man.</p>
      <p> We were within two miles of the « Bend," when, as I descended from the upper deck, being partly hidden by the wheel-house, I heard one of the officers remark to the captain, in a laughing tone, "I wonder if that young fellow up on the deck there, would smoke his cigar so unconcernedly if he only knew he was seated over twenty thousand kegs of powder?"</p>
      <p> I almost slipped overboard in my surprise. Twenty thousand kegs of powder!    Jehovah ! how much of Ma-</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-107"/>
      <p> dison Tensas, M. D., would be left, I wonder, after that quantity of explosive material had ignited under him ? One of the finest instances on record of molecular disintegration would be presented, I expect. This explains why the passengers left so summarily. I must get out of this."</p>
      <p> " I believe I will go ashore, captain ; there is where I want to land," pointing to a house at least two miles below the &lt;&lt; Stores."</p>
      <p> The boat landed; and, after getting ashore, I did not cease running until I got considerable space and a large tree between her and myself. The crew, suspecting from my movements that I had discovered the nature of their cargo, gave vent to a hearty peal of laughter, with which sounding in my ears, I gained the high-road. And this was my first introduction to the state of my future adoption.</p>
      <p> Having a letter of introduction for the principal physician in the " Bend," I slung my saddle-bags over my shoulder, and trudged along through the mud to his house, the direction of which I obtained from a passer-by.</p>
      <p> Upon  presenting  my letter to  Doctor J , I was</p>
      <p> received with as much kindness and consideration as if I had been a magnate of the land, rolling up in my carriage and four, instead of a poor young doctor, saddle-bags on shoulder, seeking a home in the swamp.</p>
      <p> Thine was a good, kind welcome, Doctor Tom, and the " Swamp Doctor," I assure you, often recurs to it with pleasure. Thine was the first stranger's hand, in my adopted state, that I pressed, and found, ere it had unclasped its pressure, that I held a friend's. Thine was the first roof in this land of hospitable homes that sheltered me ; and oh! thy hands compounded the  hrst julep  which for long, long months had ecstasied my lips, thou hast to</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-108"/>
      <p> answer to old D   e for the apostacy of one of his chosen</p>
      <p> disciples; and though I have felt contrition for the fall, yet I forgive thee, Doctor Tom, cheerfully I forgive thee. Would that one sat before me now, as I write in my lonely bachelor den, the skies obscured with darkness, the rain pattering against the casement, the single bed looking so cold, so cold, and the December blast whistling through the chinks of the logs; would that I had one now! winter as it is, though it were heaped with ice, if it came from thy hands, thy warmth of heart would impart to it some of its cordial fire, and kindle up a genial glow within my frame. Though I were thrice a Son of Temperance, I could not refrain from a julep of thy mixing, and though my lips might murmur, my heart would not dictate, " Deliver me from temptation." Oh! what a glorious barkeeper was spoiled when they made you a doctor. Doctor Tom!</p>
      <p> After partaking of a cold snack, it not yet being the dinner-hour, mounted on a horse which the doctor loaned me, I obtained the necessary directions, and turning my back on the Mississippi river, struck into the interior, in search of the contemplated location.</p>
      <p> The settlement to which I was destined, was situated on a small river which, singular to relate, as I had never heard of any member of my family having ever lived there, bore the same name as myself, being called the " Tensas." Looking upon this coincidence of names as a good omen, an assurance at least that I would meet one acquaintance or kinsman there, I surrendered my mind to a renewal of my day-dreams of future professional success and distinction, and disregarding a proper notice of the road, suddenly awakened and found myself lost—the road having given out in a cypress brake.</p>
      <p> To resolve to return was one thing, to do it another;</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-109"/>

      <p> for the timber roads so crossed and interlaced each other that I frequently found myself returning to the same point in the " brake" from whence I started. Well, thought I, I hope my future lot will be a verification of the old adage, that a " bad beginning makes a good ending," for mine is bad enough. I wandered about several hours, occasionally dismounting to assist my horse out of some slough wherein he had bogged, and was about to give it up as a bad job, when I had the good fortune to find a road, which, being over knee-deep in mud, and dotted with the bones of deceased oxen, I judged to be the main highway, which conjecture I soon verified on meeting a traveller.  After  proceeding a few miles I reached Eagle Lake, which it was necessary to cross in a shallow ferry flat. Here an accident occurred, which came near preventing these pages from ever being written. The current was running very strongly from a small bayou into the lake, and as we approached the shore, suddenly striking the flat, it impelled it with considerable force against a tree, which the high water had submerged for ten or twelve feet. I was standing in the bow of the flat, holding my horse by the rein, and the shock nearly prostrated us both. Before I could recover, the horse plunged overboard. I would have been dragged with him to almost certain death, as I could not swim, had not the ferry-man caught me, and released my arm from the rein. The steed swam to shore, and after a short time suffered himself to be mounted. Matters, so far, I must confess, had not impressed me very favourably with the country—first to be lost in a cypress brake, and then my life placed in jeopardy, looked rather like discouraging treatment; but I had determined to bear up against everything, and if these were the heaviest misfortunes I had to encounter, to laugh at care. 9</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-110"/>
      <p> Just as the sun was setting I reached the &lt;'Tensas," striking it at the "point," to the owner of which, Mr.</p>
      <p> C , I had a letter of introduction.    He received me</p>
      <p> very hospitably, and was profuse in his offers of assistance, both by employing me himself, and favourably recommending me to his friends.</p>
      <p> The night passed off, and the next morning Mr. C </p>
      <p> and myself started to visit the other families to whom I had letters of introduction and recommendation ; not two hundred yards from the house, it became necessary to cross what was called the "Island shoot." The current was running swiftly, and it was nearly swimming. My companion, better acquainted with the passage, forded it safely; but in following, my steed got astride of a submerged log, and down we both went, head and ears, under the muddy waters. I determined, if possible, not to dissolve the union between horse and rider, and therefore held on to him, and at length he scrambled out. I was thoroughly drenched, but I knew at the outset it would never do to appear to mind such an accident before</p>
      <p> an "old swamper," like Mr. C , and therefore joined</p>
      <p> him in his hearty laugh at the dolesome plight of myself and horse. To make the matter worse, I had only the suit of clothes I wore along, and was constrained to borrow a change of apparel.    I am above the average size,</p>
      <p> and both Mr. C and his overseer were considerably</p>
      <p> under; so a proper appreciation can be had of the nature of the fit. Laying off my cloth, I donned a suit of " swamp broad-cloth,"—yellow linsey—which clove to my proportions as if it were an integral portion of my frame. This time we had better luck crossing the " shoot," and after spending the day, visiting the neighbours, and making arrangements for securing the practice, we returned to the "point."    My unique  appearance created  a good deal</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-111"/>

      <p> Ill</p>
      <p> of mirth and remark during the day ; but as I ]an2:hed with the loudest, ridicule was soon despoiled of his shaft, and my indiflference at what would have affected the majority of young men, very sensibly raised me proportionately high in the opinion of the " swampers."</p>
      <p> The encouragement I had received, I thought sufficient to warrant me in locating there ; so the next morning I started, on my return, to procure a horse, and have my books and medicines brought to my new home. The settlement I designed locating in, was a very new one, the majority of the residents holding their lands merely by pre-emption claims, little of the country having been offered for sale by "Uncle Sam." There was but one frame house in the whole settlement, the dwellings with that exception being composed of logs, some with the bark yet on them, others of split trees, whilst a few, by their squared appearance, gave evidence of the broad-axe, and a greater degree of refinement in their occupants.</p>
      <p> Fortunately for me, as I thought at the outset, but unhappily, as the sequel proved, the most influential, or rather the most numerous portion of the settlers of my destined locality, were all of one family, or otherwise closely connected. Being originally from Virginia, they had all the proverbial clannishness of that highly favoured, race, and the mortal upon whom one of the "set" smiled was immediately sneezed upon with favour by the rest. They all eat with the same tastes, and used the same pair of spectacles to view men and measures. They were a hardy, vigorous, industrious set, and, divested of their foolish clannishness, irreproachable. The first year, I was a small saviour with them; the second, having aroused the ire of one of them, the whole clan were as strenuous to break me down, as the year before they had been solicitous to advance my interests; but the " Swamp</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-112"/>
      <p> Doctor" had grown beyond their reach. But I anticipate, and must return.</p>
      <p> The lands were composed of rich alluvial, deposited by the turbid waters of the Mississippi, and protected by embankments termed " levees," ungratefully thrown up to keep out the very cause to which the country owed its existence. Whenever the levees proved insufficient, or happened to break, chickens and garden-tools fell to a discount, and ducks and cat-hooks rose to a premium.</p>
      <p> The tillable land, varying in breadth from one hundred yards to several miles, lay upon the water-courses, which ramified the surface of the country, and formed, when swollen by rains or overflow, a perfect network of watery communications. The land between the tillable or cane ridges, was low swamp, almost quagmire, never thoroughly dry, and almost impassable nine months out of the year.</p>
      <p> In the height of summer the country appeared to a fair advantage, surpassing any in the world for producing the great southern staple ; but at the time I first visited it, not expecting company, it had on almost its worst garb. The mud was nearly saddle-skirt deep in the roads, and the low lands utterly impassable.</p>
      <p> I thought that never yet did country merit its name so well as it; the whole of the Louisiana bottoms being indiscriminately known as the " swamp," and people, male and female, termed " swampers."</p>
      <p> The appearance of the country would have disgusted and deterred many from settling, but it had the promise of being a sickly one, and highly suitable for a doctor-— and such was the locality I sought; besides, I was certain of making a support, and to accomplish that, I would have submitted to any and all privations.</p>
      <p> I returned safely to the " Bend," and being careful in my selection of a boat this time, to see that she had not a</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-113"/>
      <p> government contract for transporting powder, arrived at my former home, and commenced making preparations for a speedy return to my adopted " swamp."</p>
      <p> In a few days, I had concluded my arrangements, and without a sigh or a tear of regret turned my back on my student home, and sought my new location, which I reached without further adventure.</p>
      <p> CUPPING AN IRISHMAN.</p>
      <p> During  my last year's attendance on the lectures, I became the inmate, for the purpose of walking the wards, of a certain marine hospital, situated on a certain western river—of w^hich Randolph has recorded his opinion— where the patients receive—paradoxical as it may seem— tlie kindest, yet the grossest treatment imaginable.</p>
      <p> There were four or five brother  "  Rats" besides myself residing in the hospital, all candidates for graduation, and consequently all desirous of obtaining sufficient medical lore to prevent us from being thrown higher at the " ides of March."</p>
      <p> Never before—at least by any of us—was such assiduity displayed ; so much mental pabulum devoured ; so many of the latent energies of studiousness called into play, as then. No case, however disgusting, was put in the objective ; no symptom, however trivial, obscure, or mysterious, could pass unnoticed ; and the proudest soar of the bird of Jove would have passed unheeded, had a sore of another description occurred coincidently. Fingers which the previous session had never been employed in higher 9*</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-114"/>
      <p> surgery than forking a sleepy chum, or picking needlepoints out of a pretty seamstress's hand, now gracefully adapted the pliant bandage to the fractured limb, or drew the ruby with the lancet keen. No longer the sweet vision of midnight oyster-suppers illumined the mental horizon, obscured by the listening to of six long lectures daily. No longer at the " wee short hours ayant the twal" was our Ganymede summoned to evoke the spirit of the whiskey jug. No longer musingly reclining did we watch the airy genii of the best cigar, borne up heavenward on the curling chariots of their consuming earthly tabernacles. No longer—pshaw! to comprise the whole, we were studying for our degrees, preparing for the opportunity of passing our opinion on the question, " Whether the sheepskin of a young graduate, applied to his back, would be a contiguous or a continuous membrane.'"'</p>
      <p> Among the rest was Charley L , a young fellow</p>
      <p> of considerable talents—well aware, by the bye, of their possession—who having heard of my reputation for cupping, was not long in bantering me to a trial of skill, having some pretensions that way himself.</p>
      <p> "Tensas," said he one night, when we had all assembled in the apothecary's shop of the establishment, to compare notes and discuss the day, " do you think you could cup an Irishman ?"</p>
      <p> " Cup an Irishman!" repeated I, " yes, or a Dutchman, or an eel, or a buck running, or a streak of slow lightning, or anything that wears four square inches of skin.    But why do you ask, Charley?"</p>
      <p> '&lt; Why, I tried to-day, and it took me so long, and was not well done at that, that I got in late to old D 's lecture, and he looked as sour at me as if he had caught one of the vice presidents of the P. T. S., drinking something stronger than water."</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-115"/>
      <p> &lt;&lt; Well, just show your Irishman to me, and if I don't scarify and cup him in ten minutes I'll treat—that is, take notes for the whole crowd to-morrow."</p>
      <p> "  I'll  give you half an hour, and you can't do it—scarify and put twelve tumblers on him. I'll bet you a box of cig—hem — give you choice of subjects at the next raising."</p>
      <p> " Done ! when shall the trial come off?"</p>
      <p> " Right off; everything is ready. Irishman and all."</p>
      <p> In the medical ward at that time was an Irishman, evidently not long caught, whose greatest disease, from all external indications, was poverty.</p>
      <p> The weather being very inclement, and the hospital having the reputation of keeping up good fires, and feeding its inmates pretty well, Pat took an idea into his head that he would lay up within its friendly walls during the severity of the winter; so going to the mayor of the city, w^hose benevolent heart never allowed him to refuse an applicant for the city's charities, he obtained by his piteous representations and obvious want, a hospital permit, and was, in consequence of it, soon snugly ensconced.</p>
      <p> Having the faculty of bending one knee, so that no efforts could straighten the joint, he came in as a case of chronic rheumatism, and manfully the rascal stood the kind exertions to relieve him, so as to deceive the most experienced, and cause the putting of him down in the books as one of the " incurables."</p>
      <p> Charley, however, having fine opportunities of investigating the case, had his suspicions aroused as to the reality of Pat's disease, and, determining to settle the matter, selected him as my cupping subject.</p>
      <p> " Boys," said he, " I believe Pat's shamming; suppose we tell him that old D has directed him to be scarified and cupped, and Tensas can apply the remedy!"</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-116"/>
      <p> " Agreed!" said all with one voice. Filling a tray with tumblers and- a bottle of alcohol, we proceeded in a body to the ward where the victim was placidly reposing.</p>
      <p> Seeing us approach with all the apparatus for " making a night of it," Pat imagined he w^as going to be put on a more stimulating course of treatment, and his eyes fairly glistened, and his leg was, if possible, drawn still more closely to his body as he took a mental view of his situation ; no work, good lodgings, pleasant medicine, liberal diet, and at last, to cap the climax of his earthly felicity, the pure " Crame of the Valley."</p>
      <p> " Well, Pat, my boy, how do you rise to-night?"</p>
      <p> " Faith, an' good troth, young docthurs, like Inglan's tare for the ould counthry's misry, I don't rise at all at all—not aven the laste bit; here is me stretched on me back like a nagur, unable to work for my praties, or a wee drap of the crathur, ochone ! ochone !"</p>
      <p> " Don't you improve any ?    Can't you walk a bit ?"</p>
      <p> " Shure, not a bit! How am I to travel when my fut is bent up to where a rich man's boot shakes hands with a puir man ? ochone ! Its 'frade I am I'll be always here, instid of warkin', an' drinkin', an' votin', an' bein' a fray-man, as me muther was to the fore."</p>
      <p> &lt;&lt; I hope not, Pat," said I, desirous of bringing the conversation to a close, " old D has directed me to cup</p>
      <p> you, and that is what has brought us up."</p>
      <p> " Cup me, is it ? Well it's reddy I am—shure an' have been for the long time ; make it strong with the whiskey; bless the ould man, I tould him the other day, when he was prachin' the could wather, that a good strong cup would cure me as well!"</p>
      <p> Great was Pat's consternation when he found that the tumblers, from which arose the odoriferous scent of the alcohol, were to go on him, instead of their contents going</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-117"/>
      <p> in him. He would have demurred, but he saw the use-lessness of the attempt, and therefore assented to the operation with rather a lank visage, I must confess.</p>
      <p> I soon repented the wager, and wished myself well rid of my bargain ; the rascal had perfect command of the muscles of his brawny chest, and no sooner would a cup be exhausted and applied, than with a sudden contraction of the muscles, he would send it, with a simmering noise, rolling to the distant side of the bed. I tried every way, in the usual manner, to make them retain their hold, but the task was fruitless ; occasionally one would flatter me it was going to remain, but scarcely could I give my attention to the other side, when off it would come. The half hour wanted but ten minutes of being out, and the cups were still unapplied. I became almost desperate, and called up two long-nailed Kentucky nurses, and made them hitch their fingers in the folds of the integuments on either side, so as to hold the muscles tense until the cups could adhere. This plan bid fair to answer, and the jeerings, remarks, and shouts of laughter, at my apparent discomfiture, which had greeted me in that unusual place for mirth, somewhat subsided; one minute of the allotted time was left, and but one cup remained unapplied. Up to this time, the steward of the hospital had been waiting upon me, pouring the alcohol, with which to exhaust the cup, from a tumbler nearly full into an empty glass, and then turning it out, he would hand it to me, and by the time it was applied have another ready; but one remained, as I have said, and I was waiting for it, when Charley, who had a finale for his test which none of us anticipated, suddenly substituted for the empty glass, the one nearly full of pure alcohol; suspecting no such trick, and there being no time for critical examination, I stuck the candle to it, and essayed as the blaze burst out^</p>

      <p> to apply it high up on the Irishman's breast. With a rushing, roaring sound, out burst the flaming liquid all over the poor devil's body.</p>
      <p> With a loud scream, amidst the roars of involuntary laughter which attended his advent, Patrick gave a spring nearly to the ceiling, and dashing like fragile reeds the sturdy men who w^ere holding him to the floor, amidst the cries of fire ! fire ! curses in Irish, loud and long, and the crash of the shivering tumblers, as he shed himself of them, took refuge in a large bathing-tub full of water, w^hich, fortunately for him, stood in the ward.</p>
      <p> The shouts of fire alarmed the whole hospital, and here, pell-mell, came the patients to see where it was. Forms emaciated by consumption rustled against others distended by dropsy. Four forms lay mixed up in the hall, and all of them could only muster up two pairs of legs, a pair and a half of eyes, and four arms. It was as though a false alarm had been given by Gabriel, and only a partial resurrection had taken place.</p>
      <p> In one of the upper apartments was a private patient, labouring under the disease indifferently known as the blue-devils, red-monkeys, seeing injuns, or man-with-the-poker, or rather that mysterious individual had succeeded in overtaking his victim, and awful licks, to be sure, he was giving. His delirium was, that he was an alligator, and that there was a blood-thirsty minnow determined on taking his life at all hazards. Great were his struggles to preserve himself, requiring the constant presence, of two keepers to restrain him from self-immolation.</p>
      <p> Hearing the shouts of fire from below, they, acting on the conservative principle, left their patient, and sought safety in flight, not long unfollowed by the drunkard, who proceeded down stairs, until he came to the ward from whence the shouts of laughter had not ceased to issue.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-119"/>
      <p> The door being open, in he marched, presenting a fearful aspect—nearly naked, his eyes blood-shotten, and glaring with the light of delirium, his teeth clenched, with the lips drawn apart, a slight foam resting on them, blood dripping from a wound in his forehead, and brandishing a huge medical appurtenance, acting on the principle of the force-pump, and familiar to children on a small scale.</p>
      <p> Seeing Pat in the tub, the cynosure of all eyes, the man with the red-monkeys took an idea that he was the identical minnow aiming at the vitality of his alligatorship, and this would be a good opportunity of killing him off.</p>
      <p> With a loud yell, he sprung towards poor Pat, who, perfectly bewildered, let him get nearly on him, before he thought of getting out of the way.</p>
      <p> " Hould him!" he yelled, "the crathur's gone clane out of his head! Holy jabers! hould him! He'll be afther the killin' me !"</p>
      <p> But no one having time, or showing a disposition to interfere, he found he would have to bestir himself in his own behalf, and the biggest tracks, and the fastest, and the more of them, were made by the man who, previous to the time, had not moved a step for months. Through jthe long hall, down the double steps, out of the yard, and jover the commons he went, yelling at every jump, whilst 'the " man with the poker's" friend, perfectly satisfied at the result, fish-like squatted down in the tub, and then quietly suffered himself to be led back to his room.</p>

      <p> BEING EXAMINED FOR MY DEGREE.</p>
      <p> Reader  ! have you ever taken a shower-bath of a cold winter's morning ? or felt a snake crawling over you whilst in bed? or tried to sleep with a deadly fight awaiting you in the morning ? or tried to unite the oil of your nature with the agua pura of a chattering damsel, and found no alkali to effect the union—in other words, popped the question and been—refused? or swallowed poison, and no stomach-pump about ? or slept with a man with the small-pox ? or tried to write, with a couple of gabbling widows in the next room ? or run for a political office ? or shook hands with the itch ? or been w^ithout a friend or dollar, thousands of miles from home, and a catch-pole after you for your tavern bill ? or had the toothache ? or— think of the most uneasy, miserable melancholy, dolesome action, sensation, occurrence, or thought of your life. Read of nothing for two weeks but earthquakes, famines, bankruptcy, murders, suicides, and distress in its blackest form: work on your imagination until you feel yourself labouring under all these combined misfortunes, and perhaps then you may have a slight appreciation of how a young grave rat feels just before he is examined for his degree. Examined, too, by seven old dried-up specimens of humanity, who look as if they had descended for the occasion from some anatomical museum, and who have looked on death, suffering, and annual ranks of medical aspirants, until they have about as much softness of heart as the aforesaid preparations.</p>

      <p> is generally distinguished by his devotion to everything but his studies. At the commencement of the lectures he purchases a blank-book, for the ostensible purpose of taking notes of the lectures ; but unwittingly his fingers, instead of tracing the chirographical characters, are engaged in caricaturing the professor, who is endeavouring to beat into his and a few hundred kindred heads, the difference between a dirty Israelite and the 'nasty moses of an artery. He devotes the midnight hour to dissecting —pigs-feet, grouse, and devilled bones, or the delicate structure of the epicurean oyster. He strengthens his voice by making the short hours of the night-clad street alive with the agreeable annunciation, especially to nervous invalids and sick children, that he " will not go home till morning." He astonishes the professor of chemistry when lecturing upon electricity, by placing a few pounds of powder in communication with the machine, and blowing the laboratory to atoms, when the experiments are going on. He forms a pleasant surprise for his landlady by slipping into the dining-hall when the meats are on the table, and slyly inserting a dead baby, stolen from the dissecting-room, under the cover, in place of the abstracted pig, producing a pleasant sensation when discovered, and giving a good appetite to the boarders. He puts quick-lime into the young ladies' puff-box, and gives them a wash of lunar caustic to allay the irritation. He and the janitor go halves in raising game-cocks, and the expenses of a whole winter's lectures are often bet on a main.  There is always some medical book that he wishes to purchase, of course very expensive—and to obtain which he is always writing home for money to parents or guardian. John Smith suffers, and always appears in the police reports, when the first course student is put in the watch-house, and let off by the kind-hearted mayor next 10</p>

      <p> morning, on paying fees and promising to amend. To sum up the whole, the first course, with few exceptions, conducts himself in such a manner, that but little injustice is done him when he is classed with free negroes, rowdies, and low-flung draymen. But the second course —phew! what a change comes over the fellow ! You would think, to see him, that when he was born, gravity and soberness had given up the ghost, and their disembodied spirits found a carnal habitation in his cranium.</p>
      <p> He now endeavours, by unremitting attention, to retrieve lost time, and impress the professors favourably in his behalf, for he is now a candidate for graduation, and he dare not go home without his degree. His care-clad face is now seen on the foremost bench, listening with a painful absorption, and taking voluminous notes in a book— not the only thing bound in calf-skin in the room, by long odds—and always asks, with the utmost deference, long explanations on some favourite theory of the lecturer, so dazzlingly original, that he did not perfectly understand it, so bewildered was he by admiration. He smells of the dissecting-room, and takes occasion, w'hen in the presence of the professor of anatomy, of jerking out his handkerchief, and with it the half cut up hand of a subject. He eschews tobacco, whiskey, and women, joins the physiological temperance society, and collects facts for a forthcoming work of the professor of practice. He is a strong vitalist  with  i^Old Charley,^^  and lies-big with the Liebi-gian follower of acids and alkalies. He presents the pelvis of the female that obeyed the Lord's ordinance twenty-six times in ten years, to the professor of obs—ervations, and has a faculty of making himself generally useful to the whole faculty, I, to return to particularities, had followed after the manner  oifirst coursers^  and w^ould have been  a fac simile  of the candidate, or second course student,  had</p>

      <p> it not been for my habitual laziness, and perhaps an overweening confidence in my natural powers of impudence to push me through. I had had one or two fights the previous session, in the college, which brought me favourably, of course, before the notice of the faculty, as a quiet, studious gentleman, and removed all doubts from my mind of my having a safe and honourable passage. I held a high head, but was confoundedly frightened, and often wished that I were not an aspirant for the privilege of being a hired assassin, a slayer, without the victim having a chance to hit back. Many, I say, were my misgivings, as I saw the ides of March, the time for examination, approach, that my want of medical lore might knock me higher than the green baize of medicine could cluster—and yet, never was poor mortal better entitled to write M. D. after his name than I, miserable devil as I was. But fear would not keep back the evil day. The bell sounded for class T to go up and be examined, and away we went slowly, as to a summons for pistols and coffee for two, with feelings resembling those of a gambler who has staked his whole pile, and found at the  call  that he has been bluffing up against a  greenhorn  wdth '&lt;  three white aces.''^</p>
      <p> We were to be examined in separate rooms; our class, consisting of seven members, by as many professors, fifteen minutes being allotted to each professor in which to find out the qualifications of the candidate.</p>
      <p> I have already indicated the course I intended to pursue in my examination—impudence and assurance was a new method for a candidate, and might succeed where the old plan would be nearly certain to fail.</p>
      <p> Entering boldly, without knocking, the room of one of the professors, who, being a superannuated widower, affected youthfulness very much, and prided himself very</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-124"/>
      <p> much, like a Durham stock raiser, on the beauty of his calves, to his dismay I found him arranging a pair of elaborate false ones, which showed a great disposition to work around to the front of his spindle-shanks. I had him dead for his vote, sure. I held the calves, whilst he adapted them to their places, and smoking a cigar during his fifteen minutes—he congratulated me upon the progress, he had often remarked, I was making in my studies, and at the expiration of his time, as he conducted me to the door, assured me he would vote for me, adding, " by-the-bye, Tensas, you needn't mention anything about the calves."</p>
      <p> Well! here's one vote, sure; would I had the other six as safe, thought I. " Physiology, where are you.?  You are wanted!" said I, as the door enclosed me with the professor of that branch, who, fortunately for me, was what is called a  vitalist —sticking up for nature, and bitterly denied the Liebigian theory, which refers so many of the living phenomena to chemistry. He and the professor of chemistry were nearly at daggers' points upon the subject, and exceedingly excitable w^henever it was mentioned in their presence.    I knew my cue.</p>
      <p> " Take a seat, Mr. Zensas, you appear wondrous full of vivacity," said the professor, as I entered, singing '&lt; A was an artery," &amp;c. "Yes, sir, and I can assure you it is vivacity of the same kind that a beneficent Creator exhaled into the nostrils of the first-created—life in the sense in which every reasonable man—every man with a proper appreciation of the subject—every man of learning and intellect, and physiological acquisition, regards the vital principle—and not that degraded vitality of the Liebigian system, which makes man's assimilating functions a chemical operation, and degrades his mighty nature to the  level of the ass"—" hideous doctrine," broke in  the</p>

      <p> old professor. " Mr. Tensas, would that the whole class possessed your discriminative wisdom ; then I could descend to the grave with the proud consciousness that man held of his existence the same exalted opinion that I have always tried to teach ; then would I see this chemical theory of life exploded. Theory which degrades man lower than the brutes, makes the subtlest operations of his nature a mere chemical effect, and the noble action of the lungs a scape-pipe for extra heat; magnificent—"</p>
      <p> And the excited physiologist, carried away by his feelings, burst into one of his wildest harangues, battling for his favourite theory with more vigour than he had ever displayed in the rostrum—and there never had stood his superior for eloquence—until a knock at the door broke in upon his declamatory current and dammed its waters.</p>
      <p> "Bless me I" he exclaimed, rubbing his glasses and looking at his watch, "is my time oat? Why, I have done all the talking. But go, Mr. Tensas, the views that you advocate attest your qualifications. You may depend upon my vote and influence."</p>
      <p> " Two votes safe !" said I, as I regained the lobby, " and now for old '  Roots,^  as the professor of Mat. Med. was familiarly called by the class—he's deaf, but thinks no one knows it but himself. I'll talk low, and he won't know whether I am answering correctly or not."</p>
      <p> " Take a seat, Mr. Tensas. How are you to-day ? I suppose you are ready for being examined.'' What is calomel ?"    All this being said  sotto voce.</p>
      <p> "A drug, sir, that may be called the right bower of quackery, and the four aces of medical murder; referred to by Shakspeare when he said, ' Throw physic to the dogs,' and specifically mentioned by him, though a typo graphical error has somewhat obscured it, evidencing its 10*</p>

      <p> " ' Be thou as pure as ice, as chaste as snow, thou shalt not escape Calumel,' "</p>
      <p> I spoke in a whisper, but moved my lips as if vociferating.</p>
      <p> '&lt; Right, Mr. Tensas ; but you need not holler so as to alarm the college ; I am not deaf. What is the usual dose in the South?"</p>
      <p> " Haifa pound for an infant, and the quadrature of the stomach's circle for a grown negro!"</p>
      <p> " What are its specific effects upon the system ?"</p>
      <p> " The free use of coffins, spit-boxes, mush-and-milk, and the invention of new oaths with which to curse the doctor!"</p>
      <p> " What diseases is it usually given in ?"</p>
      <p> " In all, and some others, from want of a clean shirt to the death-rattle!"</p>
      <p> " Right, sir, right," said the examiner, never doubting, from my aptitude of reply and perfect seriousness, but that they were to the point.    " What are emetics ?"</p>
      <p> " Medicines, that a man who has dined badly, and wants to conceal it, should never take !"</p>
      <p> "What are the most certain ?"</p>
      <p> " The first cigar, the first quid, or a spoiled oyster!"</p>
      <p> " What is their action ?"</p>
      <p> " That of money won at gambling; going back the way it came, and taking a good deal more than it brought!"</p>
      <p> " When should lobelia be given ?"</p>
      <p> " At elections, where the people are writing a man down an ass, and he wants to be  hrought-up  ahead!"</p>
      <p> " What dose would you give it in ?"</p>
      <p> " If the patient was likely to leave a rich widow, I'd certainly give a pound !"</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-127"/>
      <p> " When would you think an emetic had acted sufficiently?"</p>
      <p> " When I was in doubt whether it was the patient's tongue or his stomach that was hanging out of his mouth!"</p>
      <p> " What are purgatives ?"</p>
      <p> " Medicines, whose action bears the same relation to that of emetics, which the possums did to the hollow where the dog was waiting to catch them—they go the other way!"</p>
      <p> " Suppose your patient had a diarrhoea^ what medicine would you give ?"</p>
      <p> "A quart of brandy, for it would be sure to make him tight  /"</p>
      <p> "What are the most dangerous preparations of lead?"</p>
      <p> " Congressional speeches in Washington, and buckshot in the Southern States!"</p>
      <p> " From what does hive syrup derive its name ?"</p>
      <p> " From the fact of bees living in hives, and there being honey in it!"</p>
      <p> &lt;' Right, sir! all right! You have answered admirably. I see I must vote for you. You can go, sir!"—and out I went.</p>
      <p> "Three votes! Hurrah! Two more, and I'm safe. Now for Old Sawbones. I'm sure of him, though ;" for upon surgery I was prepared, and my intimacy with that professor assured me he must be aware of it, and would attribute the errors I might commit to natural trepidation under the circumstances.</p>
      <p> He was a man of too much good sense to wheedle or fool with, and notwithstanding my confidence in my good preparation, and his appreciation of it, I anticipated a terrible time with him.</p>
      <p> My heart sank as I entered his room, "Be seated, Mr. Tensas.    Beautiful weather for this season.    Have</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-128"/>
      <p> an apple ? Here is an instrument for deligating the subclavian artery, that the maker has done me the honour to call after me. How do you like it? Think I must order a dozen. Do to give to acquaintances," rattled on the kind-hearted professor, trying to reassure me, which he failed to do, for I regarded his pleasantry as somewhat akin to the cat sporting with its victim. "You never shave, Tensas, I believe ?    Apropos, how old are you ?"</p>
      <p> I jumped clear out of my seat at the question. The institution required a candidate to be twenty-one, which I was not, by several months.</p>
      <p> "It's rather late in the day to inquire that, professor," replied I, " you should have asked that before I paid for your ticket."</p>
      <p> "Well, you are old enough to be examined for your degree, I expect, as you'll be rejected, in all probability. How do you make chicken-soup ?"</p>
      <p> I began to get nettled, thinking he was sporting with me upon my embarrassed condition; but a glance at his face told me he was, or strongly pretending to be, in earnest.</p>
      <p> " Professor ," I said, " I came here, sir, to be examined upon surgery; not to be insulted, sir. What chicken-soup has to do with it, I cannot imagine. If you are disposed to twit me with my early life and humble occupation, I can assure you, sir—"</p>
      <p> " Stop! stop! No insult was intended, and though you, with your wisdom of almost twenty-one years, cannot see the connexion between soup and surgery, I can tell you, young man, that the success of the surgeon depends very much upon kitchen medicine. Good soup is easily digested, and strengthens the patient, but bad discomposes, and prevents the reparative action of the system. But this is not answering my question.   How do you, sir,</p>
      <p> ifilrp r&gt;V)»nlrpn «onn ?"</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-129"/>
      <p> BEING   EXAMINED   FOR  MY   DEGREE.</p>
      <p> 129</p>
      <p> Seeing that if he was not in earnest, it was the best imitation I had seen lately, I vouchsafed to answer the subtle inquiry.</p>
      <p> After I had concluded—'&lt; Mr. Tensas, you have left out a very important item in the preparation of your soup: you forgot to mention in the first instance whether you would kill the chicken or not."</p>
      <p> The glance I shot at him was too much for his gravity. Bursting into a hearty laugh, he said, "Tensas, I knew you were well prepared, but I thought I would teach you that nothing that may be conducive to the recovery of our patient, is too trivial to be remembered by the physician— also to try your temper. You have too much of the latter. The sick-bed is a fine moderator, however. Go, my dear fellow, study hard, and in ten years I will hear from you."</p>
      <p> Tears sprung into my eyes as I wrung his hand, and thanked him, on leaving his room.</p>
      <p> Four votes safe. One more, and the others may go to Hellespont. Now for chemistry.  "■  How do you do, Mr. Tensas.'' Be composed, sir. Take a chair. Happy to have the opportunity of gratifying my chemical curiosity at your expense. I expect you candidates think your professors a very inquisitive set of fellows about this time. Ha! ha!     Take a chair, sir."</p>
      <p> " Professor  .,  I am quite well, I am happy to inform</p>
      <p> you, and desirous of appearing as composed as possible. I also felicitate myself that it is in my power to display to you the fruits, as elaborated in my mind, of those eloquent expositions of chemical science which it has been my good fortune to receive, at such an inadequate remuneration, from your lips. Here is a pamphlet, very denunciatory, I am sorry to announce, of you, that I thought you would like to see. It is by the professor of physiology, and appearing first in a distant city, I .thought you might</p>

      <p> not be aware of its publication; nay admiration and friendship for you, together with my anxiety for the promotion of the Liebigian system, led me to procure a copy at an expense which, though considerable in the present dilapidated condition of my finances, never caused the least hesitation in its purchase, when the great good which doubtless would result from your early acquaintance with its pernicious principles was considered."</p>
      <p> It took me at least five minutes, in a slow, monotonous, and pompous manner, to deliver this, and only ten were left to the examiner.</p>
      <p> ^  " Thank you, Mr. Tensas, thanks for your kind consideration for myself and the system I am proud to advocate, even though it be through detraction and vituperation. I will examine it at my leisure—we have now other business before us. Gi^^e me an exposition, Mr. Tensas, of the Atomic or Daltonian theory."</p>
      <p> Down below zero went my hitherto buoyant spirits— my scheme had failed—I am gone, thought I, when up my heart bounded again as he interrupted me with, " Ah! how did you say you obtained this atrocious publication  ? Mr. Tensas, that gentleman, the author, is doing a great and irremediable injury to the cause of truth and scientific controversy. In arguing with a man of philosophical pretensions, it is to be expected that he will combat only those principles which"—and in a tone of grieved and wounded innocence, not giving me an opportunity of giving him the required exposition of the Atomic or Daltonian theory,  which I very much regretted,  the professor concluded the time allotted him for examination, saying, as I bid him adieu, " Mr. Tensas, I shall be happy to see you at my house to-night; you may rest assured of my vote." I stood in the lobby with perfect ease, confident that in having five votes out of the seven—three being re-</p>

      <p> quired to reject—I was soon to be dubbed Doctor of Medicine. The examinations of the other two professors I got through with very summarily, fainting away before one, and occupying the fifteen minutes to restore me, and before the other, being seized with a violent bleeding at my nose ; but in justification of my own honour, I must state that the representations by the rest of the faculty of the splendid examination I had passed before them, influenced their votes, and I obtained all; and, at the appointed time, received my degree, and a square yard of sheepskin, as an attestation of the progress I had made in medicine, giving me a free permit to kill whom I pleased without the fear of the law.</p>
      <p> STEALING A BABY.</p>
      <p> I NEVER was partial to dogs (although I dined some years ago very heartily upon the haunch of one, that a rascally Indian sold to the family for venison—the scoundrel's back gave proof not long after, that it, to him at least, was really dear meat); they have always been my aversion, and the antipathy of my earlier years has not been in the least diminished by the part one took—not only out of my leg—but in breaking off as pretty a love-scrape as ever Cupid rejoiced at.</p>
      <p> I was attending my last course of lectures, previous to graduation, in a northern state, and as a matter of course had but very little leisure to devote to amusement or love. But nevertheless, even amidst all my occupation, I found time to renew and continue a friendship bordering closely</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-132"/>
      <p> upon love, even then, which I had formed the previous winter, with a young lady residing in the city.</p>
      <p> We were both young—alas! that there similarity ceased ■—she was beautiful—my ugliness was so apparent that I acknowledged it myself. She was wealthy—I had nothing but my profession, it not then secure. She was— but why continue the enumeration of our contrasts? suffice it to say that we were fast approaching the condition when love in a cottage, and thoughts of an annual searching for sentimental and beautiful names occupy so much of the mind, when an infernal dog (not only of a daddy—but a real caniner) jumped—like a swamp gal into a jar of pickles—into the ring of our felicity, and left me to wail him first, and myself afterwards.</p>
      <p> I hated dogs, and the father of my beloved had an equal aversion to Southerners, and according to the degree that class stood in his estimation, the old man and myself disliked the same objects; so his daughter and myself had to meet by stealth.</p>
      <p> Twice a week the class of medical students attended clinical lectures at the hospital, which was situated in a retired part of the town; thither the young lady, on the appointed evenings, would repair, and awaiting the departure of the class, we, on our walk homewards, could talk over our love affairs without fear or interruption.</p>
      <p> This pleasant arrangement had continued until nearly the close of the session, and we had agreed that when graduated, if her father's obduracy did not soften, we would elope, when some good-natured friend kindly informed her father of our intimacy, and that even as he came then to apprise him, he had met her going to keep her appointment.</p>
      <p> Highly incensed, the old man started off to pursue her, but unfortunately did not arrive to prevent, but only wit-</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-133"/>
      <p> ncss an occurrence which atlracted considerable attention at the time. Anatomy has been ever with me a favourite branch of my profession ; and wdien a student, I never let slip an opportunity, time and material permitting, to improve myself in it by dissection. It was a passion with me; and whenever I met with a person extremely emaciated or finely developed, my anatomical eye would scan their proportions, and instead of paying them the usual courtesies of life, I would be thinking what glorious subjects they would be for museum preparations or dissection; and even when my audacious lips were stealing a kiss from the pulpy mouth of my lady-love, instead of floating into ecstasies of delight, my anatomical mind would wonder whether, even in death, electricity, by some peculiar adaptation, might not be able to continue their bewitching suction. When holding her soft hand in mine, and gazing into the star-lit ocean of her soul, I would wonder if there was not some peculiarity in the formation of her optic nerve which gave her eyes such brilliancy. My poetical rhapsodies were mingled with scraps of anatomy, and in attempting to write her some verses, after writing the first line,</p>
      <p> " The clouds which clothed yon beauteous shore with garments dark and hazy"—</p>
      <p> to save me, the nearest approximation I could make to a rhyme, was;</p>
      <p> " Pray use with me not the  ' levator labii superioris alaque nasi.'  "</p>
      <p> To tell the truth, I was becoming clean daft upon the subject,  and consumptive people and orphan children began to look on me with suspicion, but Lucy attributed my conduct to the eccentricities of genius and love.</p>
      <p> Connected with the hospital the class attended was a dead-house, as is usual in such  establishments, wliere such patients whose constitutions are not strong enough 11</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-134"/>
      <p> to stand the treatment, are deposited after death for forty-eight hours, in order that their friends may reclaim their bodies. The  morgue,  in this institution, was directly under the lecture room, but, as the door was kept locked, it was regarded as sufficiently private.</p>
      <p> On the day when my intended father-in-law was made acquainted with the clandestine meetings of his daughter and myself, I had, as usual, accompanied the class to the hospital, and, during the delivering of the lecture, becoming suddenly very faint, I was forced to leave the crowded room and seek the fresh air.</p>
      <p> As I passed the door of the dead-house on my return, I noticed that it was ajar, and curiosity prompting me to see what was within, I pushed it open and entered, closing it behind me. There were several bodies, male and female, cleanly arrayed upon the table ; but the object that attracted my attention the most was an infant a few weeks old lying by the side of its dead mother; they were both so black in the face that I w^ould have suspected foul play, had it not been accounted for by the fact that they were negroes. I strove to depart, but something formed a bond of association between that dead nigger baby and myself, which held me to my place, my gaze riveted upon it.</p>
      <p> I wanted just such a subject—one I could carry up in my private room and dissect whilst I was waiting for my meals—something to wile away my tedious hours with— but how to get it was the thing; the rules of the college and hospital were imperative, and I did not wish to be expelled. I could not beg, borrow, or buy—there was but one way left, and that was stealing.</p>
      <p> The plan was simple and easily arranged. It was very cold weather, and under the ample folds of my cloak the baby would be concealed effectually.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-135"/>
      <p> Separating it from its dead mother's embrace, I rolled it, tenderly as if alive, into as small a space as possible, and tying it up in my handkerchief, I placed it under my cloak, and left the dead-house.</p>
      <p> Had I left immediately for home, on the baby's absence being discovered I would have been suspected immediately ; so, great as was the danger, I had no other resource than to return to the lecture-room, and await our regular dismissal, running the chances of detection. No one, on looking at me then, would have accused me of feigning sickness; for, manfully as I strove to be composed, the danger of discovery unnerved me completely, and gave me such a tremor as would have passed for a creditable ague.</p>
      <p> I have been often enough in imminent danger of my life, to know what cold sweat and minutes appearing hours are ; but the longest life, in the shortest space of time I ever led, was when, in the midst of four hundred students, I sat on those hard old benches, with the dead nigger baby under my cloak, waiting for the lecture to conclude.</p>
      <p> It had its end at last; and, waiting till the class had pretty well dispersed, I sauntered slowly away towards my boarding-house, hoping that the inclemency of the weather had kept Lucy from keeping our usual appointment.</p>
      <p> A sleety rain had fallen the preceding night, and, like Mrs. Blennerhasset's tears, freezing as it fell, had covered the pavement with a thin coat of ice, making the walking for pedestrians very insecure.</p>
      <p> Surely, I thought, as a keen gust came round the corner, piercing my marrow with its coldness, her tender frame will not be exposed on such a day as this! 'tis a good thing, too; for she would be horrified if she found what my burden was;—when her smiling face, with her</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-136"/>
      <p> beautiful nose red as an inflamed  eye,  appeared, and told me I did not possess a proper appreciation of the strength of a Kentucky gal's affection.</p>
      <p> Somewhat vexed, and, for the first time in my life, sorry to see her, I wished her (as it w^as so cold) in the hottest place I knew of; but dissembling my feelings, I vowed, when she came up, that if I had received the appointment of surgeon-general to the angels, it could not give me more pleasure than to see her then. I appeared as unconcerned as I could, and sedulously talked to her of such things as are very interesting to lovers and old maids, but deuced tiresome to all other parties concerned.</p>
      <p> We had nearly reached the street corner where we usually parted, when, horror of horrors! who should we see coming round the identical corner but the lady's father, accompanied by a man that bore a marvellous resemblance to the city marshal!</p>
      <p> Instead of fainting, Lucy uttered a stifled shriek, and gritting her teeth dragged me into a house, the door of which stood invitingly open ; one step more, and if Fate had not been against me, these pages would never have been written, that baby would have been anatomized, and in all probability, instead of being an old rusty swamp doctor, " caring a cuss for nobody, nobody caring for me," I would have been the happy head of a family, and, rolling in my carriage, describe the great operation of extracting two jaw-teeth, I saw performed the last time I was in Paris. But the beautiful hath departed, and never was.</p>
      <p> A growl, a loud yell, bow! wow! wow  \  and with mouth distended like an alligator catching his dessert of flies, a huge bull dog sprang at us, placing us in rather a dilemma; it was the dog of a daddy on one hand, and the  daddy of a dog on the other.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-137"/>
      <p> Unlike Miss Ullin, who preferred meeting the raging of the skies to an angry father, embarked in a skiff and got drowned, I preferred an angry father to a mad bull dog; so seizing Lucy, I made a spring backwards, forgetting in my haste the slippery pavement; our feet flew up, and down we came in the open street, cross and pile, our inferior extremities considerably intermingled, and her ankles not as well protected from the heat as they might have been.</p>
      <p> My cloak flew open as I fell, and the force of the fall bursting its envelope, out, in all its hideous realities, rolled the infernal imp of darkness upon the gaze of the laughing, but now horrified spectators.</p>
      <p> The old man had witnessed the whole scene; springing to my feet, I assisted the lady to rise, and handed her over to her father. As he disappeared with her round the corner, I volunteered to whip the crowd, individually or collectively, but nobody seemed disposed to accept of my services. Picking up my baby, I explained the whole to a constable who was on the point of arresting me for child-murder.</p>
      <p> I sent the subject back to the dead-room, and came as near being expelled from college as ever a lover of knowledge did, to miss it. I have never seen Lucy since, and my haggard features and buttonless coat testify that the swamp doctor is still a bachelor.</p>

      <p> THE "SWAMP DOCTOR" TO ESCULAPIUS.</p>
      <p> Behold  me, then, who late was a city physician of a week's duration, a veritable "Swamp Doctor," settled down quietly, far from the blandishments of fashionable life, and awaiting, as when in town, though with not half of my then anxiety, the '&lt; first call,"</p>
      <p> A veritable " Swamp Doctor," to whom French boots and broadcloth must be obsolete ideas; the honest squatters thinking—and with propriety too—that a doctor who could put broadcloth over their stiles, must have to charge very high to support such extravagance. A charge to which it is almost fatal for a doctor to lay himself liable to.</p>
      <p> A pair of coarse mud boots enclose my feet; copperas-coloured linsey pants occupy their proper position; a gaudy plaid vest with enormous jet buttons, blanket-coat and cap, complete the equipment of my outer man. Allow me to introduce you to my horse; for Charley occupies in my mind too large a space to be passed over silently when the " Swamp Doctor" is being described. Too poor to own but one, he has to perform the labour of several, which the fine blood that courses through his veins easily enables him to do; like his master, his external appearance is rather unprepossessing; but would that thy master, Charley, possessed thy integral virtues! High-spirited art thou, old friend—for age is touching thee, Charles, though thou givest no indication of it, save in the lock of gray which overhangs thy flashing eyes. Tall in thy proportions, gaunt in thy outline, sorrel in thy</p>
      <p> (138)</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-139"/>
      <p> hue, thou hast proved to me, Charles, that there is other friendship and companioning besides human kind ; thou hast shared my lowly lot for many years, Charles—together we have passed the lonely night, lost in the swamp— breasted many an angry stream, and given light to many darksome hearts, when fever-stricken they awaited my coming, and heard thy joyous neigh and eager bound. I did not know thy good qualities, Charles, when first I bought thee, but the years that have wasted away have taught thy true worth, and made me respect thee as a man. But I must return, Charles, to when we first took up our home within the " swamp."</p>
      <p> My residence is as humble as my pretensions or my dress, being composed of split trees, and known in American parlance as a " log cabin."</p>
      <p> A lazy sluggish "  hayou'^ —as all the small watercourses in this country are Frenchifically termed—glorying in the name of the "Tensas," runs, or rather creeps, by the door, before which—on the margin of the stream— stands one of those grand alluvial oaks which C(juld canopy an army.</p>
      <p> The day is rather sultry; a soft wdnd is moving its branches, on the topmost one of which is perched a mocking-bird ; how wildly he carols, how blithesome his every movement! Happy fellow! the barn-yard, the ploughed ground, the berry-laden tree, all furnish him with food. Nature clothes him annually, and the leafy branch beneath shields him from the cold, when clouds and darkness gather around. Happy fellow! he can sing with a light heart; his wants are few, and easily supplied. Would that the " Swamp Doctor" had as little care pressing upon him, that he might join you in your song ; would that his necessities were as few and as readily provided for!  Then, too, he could mock at the world, then, too, sing</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-140"/>
      <p> like thine a joyous strain; but poverty, youthfulness, the stranger's want of loving sympathy, chill the rising ardoui of his song, and fling him back upon the cold wave of the world.</p>
      <p> But away, care, for the present! away, forebodings of the future! Be as in former days. Swamp Doctor, joyful at heart—thou hast sung in strains as wild as that winsome bird's! Let the harmony that pervades the air paint for thee the future ; and of bygones, " let the dead Past bury its dead!"</p>
      <p> Thou hast sung, Swamp Doctor! Then tune afresh thy harp, and give one strain before thy &lt;&lt; first call" shall still with its responsibilities thy harp, and clothe with sober seriousness thy youthful heart.</p>
      <p> Sayest thou so, fair bird ? then will I obey. My seat is beneath thy oak—thine I call it, for early residence hath given thee a pre-emption to it, surely—thy song is pouring through my heart, the wave at my feet is glistening in the morning sun, the soft branches overhead rustle and mingle in joyful greenness, yet I cannot sing of these fair scenes; not of them can be the burden of my song. Manhood had not set its seal upon my form ; yet not fifty holds an older heart than beats within my breast. In despite of myself my thoughts are with my calling, with the sick and suffering who are yet to cast their eyes upon my face, and from it draw their bright hope or withering despair. What, then, so proper, since sing I must, as breathing a soft prayer to the patron saint of the healing art, and invoking his assistance in my future course.''</p>
      <p> THF.   SWAMP   DOCTOR   TO   ESCULAPIUS,</p>
      <p> Wrapt in the gloom of Superstition's age. The trade of Chance and men of low degree,</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-141"/>
      <p> Long lay the Art which teaches to assuage The many pangs that mankind heirs, to be,</p>
      <p> The Art which stills the maniac's fiery rage, And bids the horrors of his vision flee ;</p>
      <p> Which soothes the pain its power cannot destroy,</p>
      <p> And whispers hope, when hearts are reft of joy.</p>
      <p> A Star arose amidst the heaven of gloom. Which bended o'er this glorious Art divine;</p>
      <p> It nobly strove the darkness to illume,</p>
      <p> And place the Science on its proper shrine.</p>
      <p> It shrank not from the strife, but dared the doom That meets full oft the soul of high design ;</p>
      <p> It 'scaped this lot, was victor loud proclaimed,</p>
      <p> And Esculapius wnth the gods was named.</p>
      <p> Years have grown old, and Time's relentless hand Has fallen on many a head of regal pride;</p>
      <p> Full many a warrior born to use command</p>
      <p> Has kiss'd the grave—that dark repulsive bride ;</p>
      <p> And many an arch whose fair proportions spanned The heaving wave, has sunk beneath the tide;</p>
      <p> Earth's mightiest things have triumphed over night,</p>
      <p> Gleamed forth in splendour, then been lost to sight.</p>
      <p> But not so thou ; for thou hast never known What 'twas to feel the waning love of them,</p>
      <p> Who, once enchanted, drink in every tone, Yet let Time chant their worship's requiem ;</p>
      <p> Forget how praises from their lips have flown, And eager seek for matter to condemn :</p>
      <p> None such thy friends—they prove with deed and heart</p>
      <p> That Friendship is of Death a thing apart.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-142"/>
      <p> Oh! Patron Saint, sure thine's a brilliant doom!</p>
      <p> We judge the future by the seasons past, And judging thus, eternity will loom</p>
      <p> Upon Creation ere thy name is classed Among the things that were.    Thou hast no tomb,</p>
      <p> Time cannot say thy glory shall not last, For it has mocked him from his earliest years And as he darkens, still more bright appears.</p>
      <p> Look on me, Patron Saint, with glance benign!</p>
      <p> An humble follower, I bend the knee. And pray thy knowledge's light may on me shine</p>
      <p> In all its splendour and intensity! So when in death my icy limbs recline.</p>
      <p> My name lik'st thine may long remembered be As one who sought the useful to pursue, And ease the pangs his fellow-mortals knew.</p>
      <p> Yes, let them write upon my lowly grave : " A true Philanthropist is sleeping here !"</p>
      <p> And I no other recompense will crave</p>
      <p> To cheer me onward in my future sphere.</p>
      <p> Such epitaph as that in truth to have</p>
      <p> Were worth all wealth that man amasses here.</p>
      <p> High Heaven!—Mock-Bird, the rest must stay unwrit!</p>
      <p> " Come, quick, Mass' Doctor, ole Missus got a fit!"</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-143"/>
      <p> MY FIRST CALL IN THE SWAMP.</p>
      <p> "  Come  quick, Mass' Doctor! ole missus got a fit I" aroused me from my poetical revery, and brought the invocation to Esculapius to an abrupt termination.</p>
      <p> I was just apostrophizing " High Heaven" when the voice outspoke; laughing at the ludicrous transition of sounds and ideas, I rolled up my manuscript and turned to take a survey of the speaker.</p>
      <p> He presented nothing remarkable in his appearance, being only a negro messenger, belonging to a small planter living at the extremity of what I regarded as my legitimate circuit of practice; from the appearance of the mule he bestrode, he had evidently ridden in great haste.</p>
      <p> Perceiving me to be laughing, and not knowing of anything in his annunciation to create mirth, he thought I had not heard him when he first spoke, and therefore repeated, " Come quick. Mass' Doctor! ole missus got a fit, an' I 'spec is monstrus low, for as I cum by de lot, I hear Mass' Bill holler to Mass' Bob, and tell him, arter he got dun knockin' de horns off de young bull, to cum in de house an' see his gran'-mammy die." But still I laughed on— there was such an odd mingling of poetry, Esculapius, missus, fit. Mass' Bob, and knocking the horn off the young bull, as to strike full my bump of the ludicrous, and the negro, sitting on his little crop-eared mule, gazed at me in perfect astonishment, as a monument of unfeelingness.</p>
      <p> Suddenly the recollection that this was my " first call,"</p>
      <p> (143)</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-144"/>
      <p> came over and sobered me in a second ; my profession, with all its sober realities and responsibilities, was again triumphant, and I stood a serious " Swamp Doctor."</p>
      <p> Ordering a servant to catch my horse, I began to prepare for the ride, by questioning the negro as to the nature of the disease, age of the patient, and other circumstances of the case, that might enable me to carry medicines along suitable to the occasion, as my saddlebags were of limited capacity, and none of the people kept medicines at home, except a few of the simplest nature.</p>
      <p> " You say your mistress has fits! Does she have them often ?" The object of my inquiries will be apparent to the professional reader.</p>
      <p> *' Not as I nose on. Mass' Doctor, although I did beam her say when she lived in Georgy, she was monstrus nar-vus-like at de full of de moon."</p>
      <p> " How old is your mistress ? do you know, boy ?"</p>
      <p> " How ole! why, Mass' Doctor, she's a bobbullushunary suspensioner, an' her hare is grayer dan a 'possum's. Ole missus ole for a fak !"</p>
      <p> " Has anything happened lately that could have given your mistress the fit?"</p>
      <p> " Nuffin', Mass' doctor, as I nose on, 'cept pr'aps day 'fore yisterday night ole missus private jug guv out, an' she tole wun of de boys to go in de smoke-house and draw him full; de fule chile stuck de lite tu nere de baril, de whiskey cotch, an' sich a 'sploshun never war herd as de ole smoke-house guvin' up de goast!"</p>
      <p> " Your old mistress drinks whiskey, then, and has been without any two days ?"</p>
      <p> " Yes, Mass' doctor, an' I 'spec it's that what's usen her ip, for she'd sorter got 'customed to de ' stranger.' "</p>
      <p> I had learned enough of the case to give me a suspicion</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-145"/>
      <p> of the disease; the verification must be deferred until I saw the patient.</p>
      <p> She being very old, nervous, and excitable, accustomed to alcoholic stimulation, suddenly deprived of her usual beverage, and brought under the depressory influences of losing her smoke-house and barrel of whiskey, was sufficient cause to produce a case of disease formed by an amalgamation  of sub-hysteria  and  quasi delirium tremens ; a not very flattering diagnosis, considered in a moral point of view, to the old lady, w^hose acquaintance I was yet to make. Knowing how much depended upon the success with which I treated my first cases, it was unnecessary to give me a serious and reflective air, that I should remember how much people judged from appearances, and that mine were anything but indicative of the doctor ; whiskers or beard had I none, and even when wearing the most sober mask, a smile would lurk at the corner of my mouth, eager to expand into a laugh.</p>
      <p> But I must start. Labelling a bottle of brandy "Arkansas Fitifuge," I slipped it in my pocket, and mounting my horse, set off upon the fulfilment of my " first call."</p>
      <p> When we reached the house, my horse reeking with sweat, from the haste with which we had traversed the muddy roads, I introduced myself, as I had never seen one of the family before, nor they me—as Doctor Tensas, and required to be shown the patient. I saw from the countenances of the assembly, which was more numerous than I had expected to find, that they were disappointed in the appearance of the new doctor, and that my unstriking and youthful visage was working fatally against me. In fact, as I approached the bed, which was surrounded with women, I  heard  one  old  crone  remark  "  sotto  voce,^^</p>
      <p> " Blessed J s! is thiat  thing  a doctor ? why, his face's</p>
      <p> as smooth as an eggshell, an' my son John 'peers a heap 12</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-146"/>
      <p> older than him, an' he's only been  pupped  ateen years; grashus nose sich a young lookin' critter as that shuddent gin me doctor's truck; he can't have 'sperience, but sens he's here we'll have to let him go on ; half a 'pology is better 'an no commisseration in an aggervated insult."</p>
      <p> Paying no attention to her depreciatory remarks, but determined to show them that I knew a thing or two, I commenced examining the patient.</p>
      <p> Had I not been prepared by the negro's description, I would have been surprised at the example of longevity in that insalubrious country which the invalid presented. Judging from external appearances, she must have had the opportunity of doing an immensity of talking in her time; her hair was whiter than the inside of a persimmon seed, and the skin upon her face resembled a piece of corrugated and smoky parchment, more than human cuticle; it clove tightly to the bones, bringing out all their prominencies, and showing the course of the arteries and veins beneath; her mouth was partly open, and on looking in I saw not the vestige of a tooth; the great dentist. Time, had succeeded in extracting the last. She w^ould lie very quietly in a dull comatose condition for a few moments, and then giving a loud screech, attempt to rub her stomach against the rafters of the cabin, mumbling out something about "Whiskey spilt—smoke-house ruined—and Gineral Jackson fit the Injuns—and she haddent the histericks!'* requiring the united strength of several of the women to keep her on the bed.</p>
      <p> The examination verified my suspicion as to the nature of the disease, but I had too much knowledge of human nature to give the least intimation to the females of my real opinion. I had been told by an old practitioner of medicine, " if you wish to ruin yourself in the estimation of your female patients, hint that the disease they are</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-147"/>
      <p> labouring under is connected with hysterics:" what little knowledge I had acquired of the sex during my student life went to confirm his observations. But if the mere intimation of hysteria produced such an effect, what would the positive pronouncing that it was not only hysterics but a touch of drunken mania ? I had not courage to calculate upon such a subject, but hastily dismissed it. Pronouncing that she  had fits,  sure enough, I commenced the treatment. Brandy and opium were the remedies indicated ; I administered them freely at half-hour intervals, with marked benefit, and towards midnight she fell into a gentle slumber. As I heard her quiet breathing, and saw the rise and fall of her bosom in regular succession, indicating that the disease was yielding to my remedies, a gleam of pleasure shot over my face, and I felt happier by the bedside of that old drunken woman, in that lowly cabin, in that obscure swamp, than if the many voices of the city w^ere shouting " laus" unto my name. I was taking the first round in the race between medicine and disease, and so far was leading my competitor.</p>
      <p> It was now past midnight: up to this time I had kept my place by the bed-side of the patient, and began to get wearied. I could with safety transfer her care now to one of the old dames, and I determined to do so, and try and obtain some sleep. The house consisted of a double log cabin, of small dimensions, a passage, the full depth of the house, running between the " pens." As sleep was absolutely required for the preservation of the patient, and the old dames who were gathered around the fire, discoursing of the marvels of their individual experience, bid fair to step over the boimds of proper modulation in their garrulity, I proposed, in such a way that there was no withstanding the appeal, that w^e should all, except the one nursing, adjourn to the other room.    The old ladies ac-</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-148"/>
      <p> quiesced without a single demurrer, as they were all dying to have a talk with the " young doctor," who hitherto, absorbed in his patient, had shown but little communicativeness.</p>
      <p> The male portion of the family had adjourned to the fodder-house to pass the night, so my once fair companions and self had the whole of the apartment to ourselves. Ascertaining by actual experiment that it was sufficiently removed by the passage to prevent ordinary conversation from being audible at the bed-side of the invalid, the old ladies, in despite of my hints of " being very tired, " really I am very sleepy," and "I wish I hadn't such a long ride to take to-morrow," commenced their attack in earnest, by opening a tremendous battery of small talk and queries upon me. The terrible breaches that it made, had the effect of keeping  mine  on, and I surrendered at discretion to the ladies,  almost  wishing, I must confess, that they were a bevy of young damsels, instead of a set so antiquated that their only knowledge of love was in seeing their grand-children. Besides, they were only exacting from me the performance of one of the prescribed duties of the country physician, performed by him from time immemorial ; and why should they not exact it of me ? The doctor of a country settlement was then—they have become so common now as to place it in the power of nearly every planter to own a physician, and consequently they attract little regard—a very important character in the community. Travelling about from house to house, he became the repository of all the news, scandal, and secrets of the neighbourhood, which he was expected to retail out as required for the moral edification of the females of his "beat;" consequently, his coming was an event of great and exciting interest to the womenkind generally.</p>
      <p> It is a trite observation, " tliat when you have rendered</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-149"/>
      <p> yourself popular with the wife, you are insured of the patronage of the husband;" apply it to the whole sex of women, and it still holds good—married or single they hold the men up, and without their support, no physician can succeed. I had imagined, in my youthful simplicity, that when I entered the swamp, I had left female curiosity —regarding it as the offspring of polished society—behind ; but I found out my mistake, and though I was very sleepy, 1 loved my profession too well not to desire to perfect myself in all the duties of the calling. I have often had a quiet laugh to myself, when I reflect upon the incidents of that night, and what a ludicrous appearance I must have presented to a non-participant, when, on a raw-hide-bottomed chair, I sat in that log cabin, directly in front of a cheerful fire—for though spring, the nights were sufficiently cool to render a fire pleasant—the apex of a pyramid of old women, who stretched in two rows, three on each side, down to the jambs of the chimney.</p>
      <p> There was  Miss  Pechum, and Miss Stivers, and Miss Limsey, on one side, and  Miss  Dims, who, unfortunately, as she informed me, had had her nose bit off by a \\ild hog, and  Miss  Ripson, and  Miss  Tillot, on the other. Six old women, with case-hardened tongues, and only  ojie  poor humble " Swamp Doctor," whom the verdict of one, at first sight, had pronounced a  thing,  to tcdk to them all! Fearful odds I saw, and seeing trembled ; for the fate of the adventurous Frenchman came fresh to my mind, who proposed for a wager to talk twelve hours with an old widow, and who at the expiration of the time was found dead, with the old lady whispering vainly " frog soup" in his ear. There it was one against one, here it was six versus one, and a small talker at that; but the moments were flying, no time was to be lost, and we commenced. What marvellous stories I told them about things I had seen, and 12*</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-150"/>
      <p> what wonderful recitals they gave me in return! How, first, I addressed my attention to one side of the pyramid, and then bestowed a commensurate intensity upon the other ! How learnedly we discoursed upon " yarbs," and "kumfrey tea," and " sweet gum sav !" How readily we all acquiesced in the general correctness of the broken-nose lady's remark, " Bless Jesus I we must all die when our time kums ;" and what a general smile—which I am certain, had it not been for the propinquity of the invalid, would have amounted to a laugh—went round the pyramid, when Miss Pechum, who talked through her nose, snuffled out a witticism of her youngest son, when he was a babe, in which the point of the joke lay in  bite,  or  right, or  fight,  or some word of some such sound, but which the imperfection of her pronunciation somewhat obscured! How intently we all hstened to Miss Stiver's ghost-story ! what upholding of hands and lap-dropping of knitting, and exclamations of fear and horror and admiration, and "Blessed Master!" and "Lordy grashus!" and "Well, did you ever!" and "You don't say so!" and "Dear heart do tell!" and what a universal sigh was heaved when the beautiful maid that was haunted by the ghost was found drowned in a large churn of buttermilk that her mother had set away for market next day! How profuse in my expressions of astonishment and admiration I was, when, after a long comparison of the relative sufferings of the two sexes. Miss Stivers—the lady who talked through her nose, in reply to Miss Dims, the lady w^ho had no nose at all—declared that " Blessed Master permittin', arter all their talk 'bout women's sufferings, she must say that she thought men had the hardest time of it, for grashus knows she'd rather have a child every nine months than scour a skillet, and she ought to know!" How we debated "whether the 'hives' were catchin' or not?" and were</p>

      <p> perfectly unanimous in the conclusion that " Sheep safern" were wonderful " truck I"</p>
      <p> Suddenly one of those small screech, or horned owls, so common in the South and West, gave forth his discordant cry from a small tree, distant only a few feet from the house ; instantaneously every voice was hushed, all the lower jaws of the old women dropped, every eye was dilated to its utmost capacity, till the whites looked like a circle of cream around a black bean, every forefinger was raised to command attention, and every head gave a commiserative shake, moderating gradually to a solemn settling. After a considerable pause, Miss Ripson broke the silence. " Poor creetur! she's gone, doctor, the Fitifuge can't cure her, she's knit her last pair of socks ! Blessed Master! the  screech owl  is hollered, and she's bound to die, certin!" " Certin!" every voice belonging to the females responded, and every head, besides, nodded a mournful acquiescence to the melancholy decision.</p>
      <p> Not thoroughly versed in the superstitions of the backwoods, I could not see what possible connexion there could be between the screech of the owl and the fate of the patient. Desirous of information upon the subject, I broke my usual rule, never to acknowledge ignorance upon any matter to ladies—from the first eruption of Vesuvius to the composition of a plumptitudinizer—and therefore asked Miss Ripson to enlighten me.</p>
      <p> I shall never forget the mingled look of astonishment and contempt that the old lady, to whom the query was propounded, cast upon me as she replied :—</p>
      <p> " How dus screech owls hollerin' make sick people die ? Blessed Master! you a doctor, and ax sich a question ! How is ennything fotch 'bout 'cept by sines an' awgrese, an' simbles, an' figurashuns, an' hiramghptix, and sich like vareus waso that the Creator works out his desine to man's</p>

Don't spose there's con-jurashun an' majestix in the matter, for them's agin scrip-tur; hut this much I do no—I never sot up with a sick body, and heard a screech owl holler, or a dog howl, or a scratchin' agin the waul, but what they dide; ef they did-dent then, they did 'fore long, w-hich pruves that the sine war true ; Blessed Master I what weke creetur's we is, sure enuf!

" Well, Miss Ply-ser war takin awfil sick arter etin a bate of cold fride col-lards—I alwase tole her cold fride collards warn't 'dapted to the delicases of her constytushun, but the poor crittur war indoost to them, and wuddent talk my device; an' it wood hav been a grate dele beter for her ef she had, as the sekil wil pruve ; poor creetur ! ef she oanly had, she mout bin a settin' here to-nite, fur her husband shortly arter, sed ef sarkumstancis haddent altired his 'tarmynashun he didn't no but wat he w^ood like to take a look at them Luzaanny botums, wair all you had to do to clar the land, war to cut down all the trese and w^ate fur the next overflow to wash them off; but pr'aps she wuddent nethur, for arter all he dident cum, an' you no she cuddent kum 'cept with him 'ceptin' she dun like Lizey Johnson's middle darter, Prin-sanna, who left her husband in the state of Georgy, and kum to Luzaanny an' got marred to a nother man, the pisen varmint, to do sich as that and her own laful husband, for I no that he borrerd a dollar of my sister Jane's sister to pay for the license and eatables for the crowd— but Blessed Master, where is I talking to!—well, as I sed.

Jes as it was got reddy for 'ministering,- but before it was guv, I heered a screech owl holler on the gable end of the cabin. I sed then as I say now, in the present case, that it war a sine and a forerunner that she was gwine to die, but the doctor, in spite of my 'swadements, gin her a tin cup of the pepper and lobely, but I nude it war no use—the screech owl had hollered, and she war called fur; an' jes to think of a nice young 'ooman like her, with the purtiest pair of twins in the world, and as much alike as two pese, only one had black hare and lite ise, an' the other had black ise and lite hare —bein' carrid to a grave by cold fride collards apeered a hard case, but the Lord is the Heavens an' he nose!

Doctor, weed better see how Miss Jimsey is ; it's no use to waste the ' Futifuge' on her, the screech owl has hollered, and she mus go though all the doctors of a king w^ar here ; poor creetur! she has lived a long time, an' I 'speck her Lord and Master wants her." And thus saying, the old lady preceded the way to the</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-154"/>
      <p> sick-room, myself and the five other old women bringing up the rear.</p>
      <p> Somewhat, I thought, to the disappointment of the superstitious dames, we found the invalid still buried in a profound slumber, her regular, placid breathing indicating that the proper functions of the system were being restored. I softly felt her pulse, and it, too, showed improvement. Leaving the room, we returned to the other cabin. I informed the family that she was much better, and if she did not have a return of the spasms by morning, and rested undisturbed in the meantime, that she would get well. But I saw that superstition had too deep a hold on their minds for my flattering opinion to receive their sanction. An incredulous shake of the head was nearly my only reply, except from the owl enthusiast.</p>
      <p> " Doctor, you're mistaken, certin. The screech-owl has hollered, and she is boun to die—it's a sure sign, and can't fail!"</p>
      <p> I saw the uselessness of argument, and therefore did not attempt to show them how ridiculous, nay irrehgious, it was to entertain such notions, willing that the termination of the case should be the reply.</p>
      <p> It would require a ponderous tome to contain all that passed in conversation during our vigils that night. Morning broke, and I went softly in to see if my patient still slept. The noise I made in crossing the rough floor aroused, and as I reached the bed-side, she half raised herself up, and to my great delight accosted me in her perfect senses.</p>
      <p> " I s'pose, young man, you're a doctor, aint you?"</p>
      <p> I assured her that her surmise was correct, and pressed her to cease talking and compose herself. She would not do it, however, but demanded to see the medicine I was giving her.    I produced the Arkansas Fitifuge, and as it</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-155"/>
      <p> was near the time that she should take a dose, I poured one out and gave it to her. Receiving it at first with evident disgust, with great reluctance she forced herself to drink a small quantity. I saw pleasure and surprise lighting up her countenance; she drank a little more—looked at me—took another sip—and then, as if to test it by the other senses, applied it to her nose, and shaking the glass applied it to her ear; all the results were satisfactory, and she drank it to the dregs without a murmur.</p>
      <p> " Doctor," said she, " ef you're a mineral fissishun, and this truck has got calomy in it, you needn't be afeard of salavatin me, and stop givin' it, for I wont git mad ef my gums is a leetle touched !"</p>
      <p> I assured her that the " Fitifuge" was perfectly harmless.</p>
      <p> " It's monstrus pleasant truck, ennyhow! What did you say was the name of it?"</p>
      <p> " Arkansas Fitifuge, madam, one of the best medicaments for spasmodic diseases that I have ever used. You were in fits last night when I arrived; but you see the medicine is effecting a cure, and you are now out of danger, although extreme quietude is highly necessary."</p>
      <p> " Doctor, will you give me a leetle more of the truck ? I declare, it's monstrous pleasant. Doctor, I'm mity nar-vous, ginerally ; don't you think I'd better take it pretty often through the day ? Ef they'd sent for you sooner I woodent bin half as bad off. But, thank the Lord, you has proved a kapable fissishun, sent to me in the hour of need, an' I wont complane, but trust in a mersyful Saveyur!"</p>
      <p> " How do you feel now, sister Jimsey ? do you think you're looking up this morning?" was now asked by the lady of screech-owl memory.</p>
      <p> " Oh, sister Ripson, thank the Lord, I do feel a power</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-156"/>
      <p> better this mornin', an' I think in the course of a day or two I will be able to get about agen."</p>
      <p> " Well, mersyful Master, wonders will never stop ! las nite I thot sure you cuddent stand it till mornin, speshully arter I heerd the screech-owl holler ! 'tis a mirrykul, sure, or else this is the wonderfulest doctor in creashun!"</p>
      <p> " Did the screech-owl holler mor'n wunst, sister Ripson?"</p>
      <p> "No, he only screached wunst! Ef he'd hollered  the second time, I'd defide all the doctors in the created wurld to 'ad cured you; the thing would have bin unpossible !"</p>
      <p> Now as the aforesaid screech-owl had actually screeched twice, I must have effected an impossibility in making the cure; but I was unwilling to disturb the old lady in her delusion, and therefore did not inform her of that, which she would have heard herself, had she not been highly alarmed.</p>
      <p> I directed the " Fitifuge" to be given at regular intervals through the day; and then, amidst the blessings of the patient, the congratulations of the family for the wonderful cure I had effected, and their assurances of future patronage, took my departure for home, hearing, as I left the house, the same old lady who had underrated me at my entrance ejaculate, " Well, bless the Lord I didn't die last yere of the yaller janders, or I'd never lived to see with my own eyes a doctor who could cure a body arter the screech-owl hollered!"</p>

      <p> THE MAN OF AEISTOCR/VTIC DISEASES.</p>
      <p> What  a queer thing is pride ! Pride, that busy devil that breaks off the point of the lancet, and lets human nature die of the big-head before common sense can bleed freely. Pride, that sticks a pretty foot in a kid slipper in the dead of winter, and the owner shortly in the grave. Pride, that keeps man from acknowledging his error, and makes him a slayer of his kind, without being justified by a doctor's degree.    Pride—but enough of philosophy.</p>
      <p> I have seen this trait of humanity illustrated in various ways, according to the temperament, education, and habits of individuals, and thought I knew something of the various workings of the foible ; but until I saw Major Subsequent, never did I know that man could find his chief glory in the possession of loathsome and incurable afflictions. But such is the fact, or rather was the fact, for the Major one day came in contact with rather a familiar friend of mine, whose known liberality is such that he never fails to give his visiters a fee simple to a small plantation. Yes, the Major is no more ! he died in my arms, or rather a portion of him did ; for my embrace, to have clasped the whole of his frame, muscle, and fat, would have had to be as comprehensive as the recipe for boiling water. Reader ! in all probability you never knew him ; if twoscore has not been chalked up against you, I know you never did, for I am now an old, bald-headed, wig-wearing Swamp Doctor, and he was buried when my natural hair was long as a Yankee pedlar's remembrance of a small debt due him.

      <p> " Major Billy Subsequent, here are some friends of mine that wish an introduction to you. Will you rise? You're sleepy! Ah, Billy, you're a grave subject. But my readers are anxious to know you. Read, then, your biography from your posthumous memoirs. You haven't got your nap out yet ?"</p>
      <p> Reader, Billy w^on't rise, so I'll have to do as he directs, and call upon your imagination to prepare him from the material I shall offer.</p>
      <p> Major Billy Subsequent, to use rather an old witticism, was one of the most classical men I ever knew. Byron must have had him in his eye—rather a large one would have been required to hold him—when he WTOte his beautiful lyric. The iles of grease! the iles of grease ! for Billy was fat almost to fatuity ; nature had set up in his inner man a laboratory to convert everything that entered his mouth into adipose or fatty corpuscles. He would have been a trump at euchre, for in an emergency he could have been played as the right bower at clubs, to which important personage he bore a striking resemblance. It would have been impossible to have hung him, for he had no neck ; his head was rather too hard to have suspended him by, and I have yet to learn that a man can be strangulated by tying the rope under his arms; so capital execution was not applicable to him, except when fish, flesh, fowl, or vegetables were to be devoured, and then his execution was capital. He had heard when very young that he, like the balance of the human race, possessed feet; but such was his abdominal rotundity grown to, that to verify the fact by ocular demonstration, was a feat, to accomplish</p>

      <p> THE   MAN   OF   ARISTOCRATIC   DISEASES.</p>
      <p> 159</p>
      <p> ■which he would have failed in toto. When we beheld his hands, we were struck with their resemblance to a pair of boiled hams, notched at the ends sufficiently to correspond to fingers and thumbs. He never trusted but one finger in the performance of friendship's manipulation, melancholy experience having demonstrated that human friendship was grown too weak to be intrusted with an entire hand. His foce was coveted by every politician in the land, being broad enough to smile upon all parties, and look lovingly to all quarters of the Union at the same time. His wind, like a doctor's visits of charity, was short, but not sweet, his oesophagus being contracted, the proximity of his stomach being supposed to affect it in this respect. Set him to walking, and his puff! puff! sent every inland planter who had cotton to ship to the bayou directly.</p>
      <p> Eeing the lineal descendant of a Scotch prince—who was hung as the finale of an unsuccessful  raid —and belonging to F. F. v., it is natural to suppose that he shared in the modesty and personal humility that distinguish his like favoured brethren ; in fact, he rather externally accomplished the thing, imitating them in every particular of common glorification, and taking exclusive grounds in things that they never dreamt of as forming subjects for self-gratulation. They referred to tradition, genealogy, or other equally as creditable sources, to prove their purity of blood and excellence of family; but Major Subsequent had another test, which with him was indubitably decisive of the present and past purity of his genealogical tree. Up to the time of my acquaintance with him, his wife, children,-and self, all were, and had been from youth, in possession of various incurable and afflicting disorders, but according to the Major's statement not one of them had ever had a plebeian or unfashionable disease. This was the Major's chief source of glory and honour.    The blood</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-160"/>
      <p> of his family was so pure, that only aristocratic diseases could make any morbific impression on their susceptible systems.</p>
      <p> He prided himself upon his Ciceronian wart and bluff Harry the Eighth proportions; every twinge of the gout was a thrill of exquisite pleasure, for only high living and pure blood could have the gout. His eldest son had the King's Evil—the King's Evil, mind you! Major Subsequent was one of those that believed that kings existed in a perpetual atmosphere of delight, and that consequently the King's Evil was only a play-synonyme for the king's pleasure, so his eldest born had little of his sympathy. His youngest son was terribly humpbacked, but this gave the Major no uneasiness, for were not Alexander and Richard humpbacked kings? One of his daughters was an old maid, " but then," argued the Major, consoling his child under this terrible disease, " Queen Elizabeth and Cleopatra died old maids, and why not you ?" Another had a perpetual leer upon her countenance, " but then," quoth the Major, turning to a volume of Shakspeare, " there was a king Lear, a kingly precedent. Miss Subsequent; so don't talk of being operated upon for strabismus." His wife— but enough, you know the man. The Major was very proud of his family, or rather of his family's diseases, cherishing them in much the same spirit that Jenner, the father of vaccination, did his experimental cow, for the scab upon her.</p>
      <p> I became a great favourite with the Major, not that I was diseased in any way, but on the contrary always enjoyed good health, but he said that as I was onf of the chivalry, he was certain if I ever got sick, it would be a</p>
      <p> gentlemanly disease, and none of your d n plebeian,</p>
      <p> chill-and-fever, poor folks' affections.</p>
      <p> I used to visit the Major's house often, for the purpose</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-161"/>
      <p> of studying his character, and getting a good dinner; for the Major fed well, all but horses, and they had to trust the chances of a stray nubbin falling through the chinks of the stable loft. Taking good care of a horse meant, with him, tying him to a fence, with nothing to eat  but the dead wood. Taking extraordinary care signified hitching him to a green sapling, where he could have the privilege of gnawing the bark.</p>
      <p> My open admiration of his character soon elevated me to the post of family physician—nearly a sinecure—for the Major was afraid to take medicine, not wishing to part with his hereditary honours.</p>
      <p> One day, I had just finished my dinner at home, and had taken, cigar in mouth, my usual seat beneath a favourite oak, to indulge in a fit of meditation, when I saw the dust up the bayou road shaken up by a half-naked negro, who, having no pockets in his shirt, and being hat-less, holding a letter in his teeth, was urging his mule along at the top of his speed. At a glance, I knew it was the Major's boy, or rather mule, for no one in the settlement save him ow^ned an animal, the ribs of which could be counted at almost any distance.</p>
      <p> They arrived; and first asking me for a chaw of tobacco, the negro delivered the note, which, true to my surmise, was from the Major, and written apparently under high excitement, requesting me to come up immediately, as he apprehended something terrible had either happened, or was going to occur.</p>
      <p> My horse being ready saddled, in a short time I was at the Major's, whom I found waddlin^ up and down his long gallery, his path distinctly marked by the huge drops of sweat that had fallen from his brow.</p>
      <p> " Doctor, I am truly rejoiced at your arrival; my worst apprehensions have been excited upon a subject,  upon 13*</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-162"/>
      <p> which the honour of my family depends, and the firm fame of my ancestors."</p>
      <p> Thinking from his language there was a lady in the case, I told him that marriage would cure all indiscretions, and muttered something about accidents and the best of families.    The Major understood only the conclusion.</p>
      <p> "Best of families!" repeated he. "Yes, doctor, not only of the best, but the very best. I pride myself upon, my blood. Mine is no upstart claim of a thousand years or so, but, doctor, drawn from the very creation, and transmitted in a stream of pure brilliancy down to me. But, doctor, something has occurred to-day, I fear, which, if it be as my darkest and gloomiest thoughts suggest, will prove my death, bring ruin and disgrace upon my house, and extinguish the ancient torch of the Subsequents like a farthing dip. I have looked over my list of ancestors, from the creation up, and find to my ineffable horror not one of them ever died with any but a noble and kingly disease. I know I have received the stream in all its pristine purity—and oh, doctor, on your honour as a man, on the awful sanctity of your calling, never reveal to mortal the terrible disclosure I am about to make. Doctor Tensas, I fear my eldest born has got—faugh ! I sicken at the thought—the chill and fever! Oh, Lord ! terrible ! awful! horrible ! Is it not enough to madden a man, to think, after having only noble diseases in his family, for twenty thousand years at least, that a cursed, plebeian, vulgar disease, which every negro and low poor man can have, should dare present itself in the habitation of ariat^Jratic and kingly affections. Doctor, if it be as I fear, I shall go deranged! I shall die! I will disinherit the rascal! He shall change his name! To think of gout, king's evil, humpback, and their royal brethren, to attest my purity of blood, and then for chi—</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-163"/>
      <p> faugh! it is too horrible to be true ! Go, doctor, examine him. Heaven grant my fears may be groundless, or I shall certainly die.    I cannot survive the disgrace."</p>
      <p> Going into the room where the patient lay, I examined him, and sure enough chill and fever  was tJiere  in all its perfection.</p>
      <p> Fearing the effect the revelation might have upon the Major, I attempted a pious fraud, and blundered out something about its being a strange, singular, and anomalous affection, not laid down in the books—never had seen anything like it before. Certainly not chill and fever, though even if it were—ha! ha!—it was still a disease, though debased very much in modern times, I must confess, not to be looked on with coolness, as James the Second and Oliver Cromwell were said to have died of it.</p>
      <p> " Doctor Tensas, don't deceive me," said the Major. I assured him that I did not—that his son had not the chill and fever. I was not fully assured of the nature of his disease, but he might rest easy, as far as ague was concerned.</p>
      <p> Reassured and comforted by my positive declaration and manner, the Major heaved a deep sigh of relief, and asked me to stay all night. I would have assented, but my old sorrel, remembering his well filled trough at home, and fearing some such arrangement, put in an impatient and positive nay, and I departed.</p>
      <p> A day passed in quietude ; but who knows what the morrow will bring forth.'' I was summoned, in greater haste than before, to the Major's. On reaching there, T found him writhing in pain, both bodily and mentally, with a handful of buttons, and a couple of jaw-teeth with them, somewhat decayed.</p>
      <p> " Doctor Tensas," he thundered out, "by the Eternal</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-164"/>
      <p> you deceived me. My son had the chill and fever. He has it now ! Now, sir, now! Look at these buttons off and these teeth shaken out, and then tell me if the blood of a line of noble ancestors is not defiled, and my family disgraced forever?—my son have the chill and fever!" and a shudder ran over his frame. "Chill and fever! Ha! ha! ha!" a fit of hysterical, demoniacal laughter came over him. " Chill and fever! Ha! ha! ha!" gurgled, mixed with the death-rattle from his throat. I looked in his face—and thus died Major Billy Subsequent, F. F. V. &amp;c., of a chill and fever his son had!</p>
      <p> THE INDEFATIGABLE BEAR-HUNTER.</p>
      <p> In  my round of practice, I occasionally meet with men whose peculiarities stamp them as belonging to a class composed only of themselves. So different are they in appearance, habits, taste, from the majority of mankind, that it is impossible to classify them, and you have therefore to set them down as queer birds '&lt; of a feather," that none resemble sufficiently to associate with.</p>
      <p> I had a patient once who was one of these queer ones; gigantic in stature, uneducated, fearless of real danger, yet timorous as a child of superstitious perils, born literally in the woods, never having been in a city in his life, and his idea of one being that it was a place where people met together to make whiskey, and form plans for swindling country folks. To view him at one time, you would think him only a whiskey-drinking, bear-fat-lo\ing mortal;   at other  moments, he would  give vent  to  ideas,</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-165"/>
      <p> proving that beneath his rough exterior there ran a fiery-current of high enthusiastic ambition.</p>
      <p> It is a favourite theory of mine, and one that I am fond of consoling myself with, for my own insignificance, that there is no man born who is not capable of attaining distinction, and no occupation that does not contain a path leading to fame. To bide our time is all that is necessary. I had expressed this view in the hearing of Mik-hoo-tah, for so w^as the subject of this sketch called, and it seemed to chime in with his feelings exactly. Born in the woods, and losing his parents early, he had forgotten his real name, and the bent of his genius inclining him to the slaying of bears, he had been given, even when a youth, the name of Mik-hoo-tah, signifying " the grave of bears," by his Indian associates and admirers.</p>
      <p> To glance in and around his cabin, you would have thought that the place had been selected for ages past by the bear tribe to yield up their spirits in, so numerous were the relics. Little chance, I ween, had the cold air to whistle through that hut, so thickly was it tapestried with the soft, downy hides, the darkness of the surface relieved occasionally by the skin of a tender fawn, or the short-haired irascible panther. From the joists depended bear-hams and tongues innumerable, and the ground outside v/as literally white with bones. Ay, he was a bear-hunter, in its most comprehensive sense—the chief of that vigorous band, whose occupation is nearly gone—■ crushed beneath the advancing strides of romance-destroying civilization. When his horn sounded—so tradition ran—the bears began to draw lots to see who should die that day, for painful experience had told them the uselessness of all endeavouring to escape. The " Big Bear of Arkansas" would not have given him an hour's extra work, or raised a fresh wrinkle on his already care-corru-</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-166"/>
      <p> gated brow. But, though almost daily imbruing his hands in the blood of Bruin, Mik-hoo-tah had not become an impious or cruel-hearted man. Such was his piety, that he never killed a bear without getting down on his knees— to skin it—and praying to be d—ned if it warn't a buster ; and such his softness of heart, that he often wept, when he, by mistake, had killed a suckling bear—depriving her poor offspring of a mother's care—and found her too poor ft) be eaten. So indefatigable had he become in his pursuit, that the bears bid fair to disappear from the face of the swamp, and be known to posterity only through the one mentioned in Scripture, that assisted Elisha to punish the impertinent children, when an accident occurred to the hunter, which raised their hopes of not being entirely exterminated.</p>
      <p> One day, Mik happened to come unfortunately in contact with a stray grizzly fellow, who, doubtless in the indulgence of an adventurous spirit, had wandered away from the Rocky Mountains, and formed a league for mutual protection with his black and more effeminate brethren of the swamp. Mik saluted him, as he approached, with an ounce ball in the forehead, to avenge half a dozen of his best dogs, who lay in fragments around ; the bullet flattened upon his impenetrable skull, merely infuriating the monster; and before Mik could reload, it was upon him. Seizing him by the leg, it bore him to the ground, and ground the limb to atoms. But before it could attack a more vital part, the knife of the dauntless hunter had cloven its heart, and it dropped dead upon the bleeding form of its slayer, in which condition they were shortly found by Mik's comrades. Making a litter of branches, they placed Mik upon it, and proceeded with all haste to their camp, sending one of the company by a near cut for me, as I was the nearest physician.</p>

      <p> When I reached their temporary shelter I found Mik doing better than I could have expected, with the exception of his wounded leg, and that, from its crushed and mutilated condition, I saw would have to be amputated immediatelj^, of which I informed Mik. As I expected, he opposed it vehemently; but I convinced him of the impossibility of saving it, assuring him if it were not amputated, he would certainly die, and appealed to his good sense to grant permission, which he did at last. The next difficulty was to procure amputating instruments, the rarity of surgical operations, and the generally slender purse of the " Swamp Doctor," not justifying him in purchasing expensive instruments. A couple of bowie-knives, one ingeniously hacked and filed into a saw—a tourniquet made of a belt and piece of stick—a gun-screw converted for the time into a tenaculum—and some buckskin slips for ligatures, completed my case of instruments for amputation. The city physician may smile at this recital, but I assure him many a more difficult operation than the amputation of a leg, has been performed by his humble brother in the " swamp," with far more simple means than those I have mentioned. The preparations being completed, Mik refused to have his arms bound, and commenced singing a bear song; and throughout the whole operation, which was necessarily tedious, he never uttered a groan, or missed a single stave. The next day, I had him conveyed by easy stages to his pre-emption; and tending assiduously, in the course of a few weeks, he had recovered sufficiently for me to cease attentions, I made him a wooden leg, which answered a good purpose; and with a sigh of regret for the spoiling of such a good hunter, I struck him from my list of patients.</p>
      <p> A few months passed over and I heard nothing more of him.    Newer, but not brighter, stars were in the as-</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-168"/>
      <p> cendant, filling with their deeds the clanging trump of bear-killing fame, and, bvit for the quantity of bear-blankets in the neighbouring cabins, and the painful absence of his usual present of bear-hams, Mik-hoo-tah bid fair to suffer that fate most terrible to aspiring ambitionists—for-getfulness during life. The sun, in despair at the stern necessity which compelled him to yield up his tender offspring, day, to the gloomy grave of darkness, had stretched forth his long arms, and, with the tenacity of a drowning man clinging to a straw, had clutched the tender whispering straw-like topmost branches of the trees—• in other w^ords it was near sunset — when I arrived at home from a long wearisome semi-ride-and-swim through the swamp. Receiving a negative to my inquiry whether there were any new calls, I was felicitating myself upon a quiet night beside my tidy bachelor hearth, undisturbed by crying children, babbling women, or amorous cats— the usual accompaniments of married life—when, like a poor henpecked Benedick crying for peace when there is no peace, I was doomed to disappointment. Hearing the splash of a paddle in the bayou running before the door, I turned my head towards the bank, and soon beheld, first the tail of a coon, next his body, a human face, and, the top of the bank being gained, a full-proportioned form clad in the garments which, better than any printed label, wrote him down raftsman, trapper, bear-hunter. He was a messenger from the indefatigable bear-hunter, Mik-hoo-tah. Asking him what was the matter, as soon as he could get the knots untied which two-thirds drunkenness had made in his tongue, he informed me, to my sincere regret, that Mik went out that morning on a bear-hunt, and in a fight with one had got his leg broke all to flinders, if possible worse than the other, and that he wanted me to come   quickly.    Getting into  the  canoe,  which</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-169"/>
      <p> awaited me, I wrapped myself in my blanket, and yielding to my fatigue, w^as soon fast asleep. I did not awaken untd the canoe striking against the bank, as it landed at Mik's pre-emption, nearly threw me in the bayou, and entirely succeeded with regard to my half-drunken pad-dler, who—like the sailor who circumnavigated the world and then was drowned in a puddle-hole in his own garden—had escaped all the perils of the tortuous bayou to be pitched overboard when there was nothing to do but step out and tie the dug-out. Assisting him out of the water, we proceeded to the house, when, to my indignation, I learnt that the drunken m^essenger had given me the long trip for nothing, Mik only wanting me to make him a new wooden leg, the old one having been completely demolished that morning.</p>
      <p> Relieving myself by a satisfactory oath, I would have returned that night, but the distance was too great for one fatigued as I was, so I had to content myself with such accommodations as Mik's cabin afforded, which, to one blessed like myself with the happy faculty of ready adaptation to circumstances, was not a very difficult task.</p>
      <p> I was surprised to perceive the change in Mik's appearance. From nearly a giant, he had wasted to a mere huge bony frame-work ; the skin of his face clung tightly to the bones, and showed nothing of those laughter-moving features that were wont to adorn his visage ; only his eye remained unchanged, and it had lost none of its brilliancy —the flint had lost none of its fire.</p>
      <p> " What on earth is the matter with you, Mik? I have never seen any one fall off so fast; you have wasted to a skeleton—surely you must have the consumption."</p>
      <p> " Do you think so. Doc .'' I'll soon show you whether the old bellows has lost any of its force !" and hopping to the door, which he threw wide open, he gave a death-hug 14</p>

      <p> rally to his dogs, in such a loud and piercing tone, that I imagined a steam whistle was being discharged in my ear, and for several moments could hear nothing distinctly.</p>
      <p> «&lt; That will do! stop !" I yelled, as I saw Mik drawing in his breath preparatory to another effort of his vocal strength ; " I am satisfied you have not got consumption; but what has wasted you so, Mik ? Surely, you ain't in love ?"</p>
      <p> "Love! h-11! you don't suppose. Doc, even if I was 'tarmined to make a cussed fool of myself, that there is any gal in the swamp that could stand that hug, do you?" and catching up a huge bull-dog, who lay basking himself by the fire, he gave him such a squeeze that the animal yelled with pain, and for a few moments appeared dead. " No, Doc, it's grief, pure sorrur, sor-rur. Doc.' when I looks at what I is now and what I used to be! Jes think, Doc, of the fust hunter in the swamp having his sport spilte, like bar-meat in summer without salt! Jes think of a man standin' up one day and blessing old Master for having put bar in creation, and the next cussing high heaven and low h-11 'cause he couldn't 'sist in puttin' them out! Warn't it enough to bring tears to the eyes of an Injun tater, much less take the fat off a bar-hunter.'' Doc, I fell off like 'simmons arter frost, and folks as doubted me, needn't had asked whether I war 'ceitful or not, for they could have seed plum threw me ! The bar and painter got so saucy that they'd cum to the tother side of the bayou and see which could talk the impudentest! &lt; Don't you want some bar-meat or painter blanket  }^  they'd ask ; &lt; bars is monstrous fat, and painter's hide is mighty warm!' Oh! Doc, I was a miserable man! The sky warn't blue for me, the sun war always cloudy, and the shade-trees gin no shade</p>

      <p> THE   INDEFATIGABLE   BEAR-HUNTER.</p>
      <p> 171</p>
      <p> for me. Even the dogs forgot me, and the little children quit coming and asking, ' Please, Mr. Bar-Grave, cotch me a young bar or a painter kitten.' - Doc, the tears would cum in my eyes and the hot blood would cum biling up from my heart, when I'd hobble out of a sundown and hear the boys tell, as they went by, of the sport they'd had that day, and how the bar fit 'fore he was killed, and how fat he war arter he was slayed. Long arter they was gone, and the whip-poor-will had eat up their voices, I would sit out there on the old stump, and think of the things that used to hold the biggest place in my mind when I was a boy, and p'raps sense I've bin a man.</p>
      <p> " I'd heard tell of distinction and fame, and people's names never dying, and how Washington and Franklin, and Clay and Jackson, and a heap of political dicshunary-folks, would live when their big hearts had crumbled down to a rifle-charge of dust; and I begun, too, to think. Doc, what a pleasant thing it would be to know folks a million years off would talk of me like them, and it made me 'tarmine to 'stinguish myself, and have my name put in a book with a yaller kiver. I warn't a genus. Doc, I nude that, nor I warn't dicshunary; so I detarmined to strike out in a new track for glory, and 'title myself to be called the ' bear-hunter of Ameriky.' Doc, my heart jumpt up, and I belted my hunting-shirt tighter for fear it would lepe out when I fust spoke them words out loud.</p>
      <p> " &lt; The bar-hunter of Ameriky!' Doc, you ,know whether I war ernin' the name when I war ruined. There is not a child, white, black, Injun, or nigger, from the Arkansas line to Trinity, but what has heard of me, and I were happy when"—here a tremor of his voice and a tear glistening in the glare of the fire told the old fellow's emotion—" when—but les take a drink—Doc, I found I was dying—I war gettin' weaker and weaker—I nude</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-172"/>
      <p> your truck warn't what I needed, or I'd sent for you. A bar-hunt war the medsin that ray systum required, a fust class bar-hunt, the music of the uogs, the fellers a screaming, the cane poppin', the rifles crackin', the bar growl-in', the fight hand to hand, slap goes his paw, and a dog's hide hangs on one cane and his body on another, the knife glistenin' and then goin' plump up to the handle in his heart!—Oh! Doc, this was w^hat I needed, and I swore, since death were huggin' me, anyhow, I mite as well feel his last grip in a bar-hunt.</p>
      <p> " I seed the boys goin' long one day, and haled them to wait awhile, as I believed I would go along too. I war frade if I kept out of a hunt much longer I \vood get outen practis. They laughed at me, thinkin' I war jokin'; for wat cood a sick, old, one-legged man do in a bar-hunt  ?  how cood he get 'threw the swamp, and vines, and canes, and backwater? and s'pose he mist the bar, how war he to get outen the way ?</p>
      <p> &lt;&lt; But I w^ar 'tarmined on goin'; my dander was up, and I swore I wood go, tellin' them if I coodent travel 'bout much, I could take a stand. Seein' it war no use tryin' to 'swade me, they saddled my poney, and off we started. I felt better right off. I knew I cuddent do much in the chase, so I told the fellers I would go to the cross-path stand, and wate for the bar, as he would be sarten to cum by thar. You have never seed the cross-path stand. Doc. It's the singularest place in the swamp. It's rite in the middle of a canebrake, thicker than bar on a bar-hide, down in a deep sink, that looks like the devil had cummenst diggin' a skylite for his pre-emption. I knew it war a dangersome place for a well man to go in, much less a one-leg cripple ; but I war 'tarmined that time to give a deal on the dead wood, and play my hand out. The boys gin me time to get to the stand, and then cum-</p>

      <p> menst the drive. The bar seemed 'tarmined on disap-pinting me, for the fust thing I heard of the dogs and bar, they was outen hearing. Everything got quiet, and I got so wrathy at not being able to foller up the chase, that I cust till the trees cummenst shedding their leaves and small branches, when I herd them lumbrin back, and I nude they war makin' to me. I primed old  &lt;■  bar death' fresh, and rubbed the frizin, for it war no time for rifle to get to snappin'. Thinks I, if I happen to miss, I'll try what virtue there is in a knife—when, Doc, my knife war gone. H-11! bar, for God's sake have a soft head, and die easy, for I  can''t  run!</p>
      <p> " Doc, you've hearn a bar bustin' threw a cane-brake, and know "how near to a harrycane it is. I almost cummenst dodgin' the trees, thinkin' it war the best in the shop one a comin', for it beat the loudest thunder ever I heard ; that ole bar did, comin' to get his death from an ole, one-legged cripple, what had slayed more of his brethren than his nigger foot had ever made trax in the mud. Doc, he heerd a  monstrus long ways ahead of the dogs.  I warn't skeered, but I m^ust own, as I had but one shot, an' no knife, I wud have prefurd they had been closer. But here he cum! he bar—big as a bull—boys off h-ll-wards—dogs nowhar—no knife—but one shot— a?id only one leg that cood run!</p>
      <p> " The bar 'peered s'prised to see me standin' ready for him in the openin'; for it war currently reported 'mong his brethren that I war either dead, or no use for bar. 1 thought fust he war skeered ; and, Doc, I b'leve he war, till he cotch a sight of my wooden leg, and that toch his pride, for he knew he would be hist outen every she bear's company, ef he run from a poor, sickly, one-legged cripple, so on he cum, a small river of slobber pourin from his mouth, and the blue smoke curlin outen his ears.

The ball struck him on the eyebrow, and glanced off, only stunnin' him for a moment, jes givin' me time to club my rifle, an' on he kum, as fierce as old grizzly. As he got in reach, I gin him a lick 'cross the temples, brakin' the stock in fifty pieces, an' knockin' him senseless. I struv to foUer up the lick, when. Doc, I war fast—my timber toe had run inter the ground, and I cuddent git out, though I jerked hard enuf almost to bring my thigh out of joint. I stuped to unscrew the infurnal thing, when the bar cum too, and cum at me agen. Vim ! I tuck him over the head, and, cochunk, he keeled over. H-11! but I cavorted and pitched.

I let him get close, an' then cum down with a perfect tornado on his head, as I thought; but the old villin had learnt the dodge—the barrel jes struck him on the side of the head, and glanst off, slinging itself out of my hands bout twenty feet 'mongst the thick cane, and thar I war in a fix sure. Bar but little hurt—no gun—no knife—no dogs—no frens—no chance to climb—an'  only one leg that cood run.  Doc, I jes cummenst makin' 'pologies to ole Master, when an idee struck me. Doc, did you ever see a piney woods nigger pullin at a sassafras root.? or a suckin' pig in a tater patch arter the big yams ? You has !

      <p> LOVE IN A GARDEN.</p>
      <p> In  the whole range of human attributes there are not two more antagonistical qualities than courage and cowardice ; yet, how frequently we find them existing in the same person, ensconced under the same coat of skin ! In the form that contains a spirit that would face with un-')lenching eye the fiercest peril of man's existence, we will often discover a timorous sprite, who hems and hesitates, and falters and trembles, at an enemy no more formidable than a pair of soft blue eyes, pouring their streams of liquid subduing tenderness, or else a brace of piercing black orbits, which, like the fire of the ancient Greeks, burn the fiercer for the water which love pours over them, in the shape of tears.</p>
      <p> And, odd as it may seem, this discordant association of.heroism and timidity is not found in weak effeminate nervous men, but in those whose almost gigantic proportions, eagle eye, and dauntless bearing convey any idea but that there is stuff for trembling in their stalwart frames. But they are the ones who generally manifest the greatest cowardice—place them before a battery of girls' eyes, and it proves literally a  gal-\amc  battery, shocking them to such a degree that they usually do something they never intended, and say things that they never meant. Let one of these animals be in love, and what a mess he generally makes of the affair! Did you ever know one to " pop the question" in a respectable civilized manner ?—That is, if he ever exalted his courage sufficiently to get that near to matrimony.    My word for</p>
      <p> (176)</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-177"/>
      <p> it—never. No suit for breach of promise could be ever brought against one of them—for such is the non-committalism of their incoherency, that no woman, on her oath, could avow, even were they  conjugated  at the time, that he ever asked her to marry him ; the intuitive feeling of her sex alone enabled her to draw the idea that he was addressing her, from the mass of his discordant, incoherent, lingual ramblings, when the question was being popped.</p>
      <p> This philosophizing is intended as a preface or premonitory symptom of a story, illustrative of the trait; which, like measles, when repelled by cold air, has struck in upon my memory, and which, carrying out the idea, requires, like the aforesaid measles, to be brought to the surface in order that I may feel relieved.</p>
      <p> Among the many acquaintances that my profession enabled me to make in the swamp, no one afforded me more pleasure than Jerry Wilson, the son of a small planter resident some few miles from my  shingle.  There was something so manly and frank in his bearing that our feelings were irresistibly attracted towards him. In my case it proved to be mutual: he seemed to take the same interest in me, and we soon became bosom friends. A severe attack of congestive fever that I carried him through successfully, riveted him to me for ever; and Jerry, upon all and every occasion, stood ready to take up the gauntlet in my defence, as willingly as in his own. Being very popular in the neighbourhood, he became of great assistance to me, by advocating my cause, and extending, by his favourable representations, my circle of practice.</p>
      <p> The plantation adjoining Jerry's father's was possessed by an old, broken-down Virginian, who, having dissipated one fortune in conforming to the requirements of fashionable life, had come into the swamp, to endure its many</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-178"/>
      <p> privations, in order that he might recruit his impoverished finances.</p>
      <p> Adversity, or something better, had taught him the folly of the prominent foible of the Virginian—insane state pride, and consequent individual importance. His mind was prepared to test men by the proper criterion— merit, without regard to the adventitious circumstances of birth, wealth, or nativity.</p>
      <p> Major Smith deserves the meed, I believe, for being' the first one of the race to acknowledge that he was not an F. F.; which confession, showing his integrity of character, proved to me that he really was one of the very first of the land. But, in describing the father, I am neglecting by far the most interesting, if not the most important character of the story—his daughter—a sweet blooming girl of seventeen, at the time of which I write. Ah! she was the bright exemplar of her sex! Look in her eye—so luminous, yet so tender, and far down in its dreamy still waters, you could see the gems of purity and feeling glimmering; listen to her voice—and never yet forest bird, on the topmost leafy bough, gave forth such a gush of melody, as when it rose and melted away in a laugh ; her modesty and timidity—you have seen the wild fawn, when, pausing on the brink of some placid lake, it sees its beautiful image reflected in the waters—thus shrank she, as if into herself, when voice of love, or praise, or admiration stole into her ears—and yet, with all her maidenly reserve and timidity, she loved and was beloved. Knowing that I am a bachelor, think not, in this recital, that my swelling heart is tearing open anew wounds which time and philosophy have just enabled me to heal. No! my fair friend—for friend she was, and is—never kindled in my heart the flames of love, or heard aught of the soft impeachment from me; for, long before I had seen her,</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-179"/>
      <p> the " Swamp Doctor" had wedded his books and calling •—rather a frigid bride, but not an unprolific one, and her yearly increase, instead of bringing lines of anxiety to my brow, smooths the wrinkles that care and deep thought— certainly it cannot be age—Lord! Lord ! I have broken my wig spring—have dropped upon my visage!</p>
      <p> My friend Jerry was the favoured mortal, and, without doubt, in an equal intensity reciprocated her love ; but cowardice had hitherto prevented an avowal upon his part, and the two lovers, therefore, dwelt in a delicious state of uncertainty and suspense. No one, to know Jerry, as the majority of men — going through the world with their noses either too elevated or too depressed for observation—know their kind, would have thought him a coward: but I knew, that, as respected women, a more arrant poltroon did not exist. He would have met any peril that resolution, strength, or a contempt for life could overcome, without fear of the consequences or the least tremor; and yet he dared not for his life tell a pretty girl "that he loved her, and would be highly pleased, and sorter tickled, too, if she would marry him." There was something more terrible in the idea of such an avowal, than fighting bears, hugging Indians, or strangling panthers.</p>
      <p> The poor girl, with the intuitive perception of her sex, had long perceived that Jerry loved her as ardently as if the avowal on his part had already been made. Almost daily she saw him, eagerly she awaited a declaration, but poor Jerry never could get his courage to the sticking point; like Bob Acres, it would ooze out at his fingers' points, in spite of himself and his determination to bring things to the condition of a fixed fact.</p>
      <p> Matters were in this state when I became fully -acquainted with them ; she was willing, he was willing, and</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-180"/>
      <p> yet, if they kept on in the way they were pursuing, they both bid fair to remain in single blessedness for a long time to come. Deeply interested in the welfare of both parties, I thought I could not manifest my sympathy better than by kindly intervening and producing that crisis which I knew would accord with the feelings of both,</p>
      <p> A slight attack of fever of the lady's, not requiring medical aid, but which a father's fears magnified, and would not be allayed until I had been sent for, introduced me fully to the confidence of the daughter ; and a trite experiment, which I tried upon her, convinced me that all that my friend Jerry had to do was to ask, and it would be given.</p>
      <p> Holding my fair patient's hand, which, resting in mine, looked like a pearl in a setting of jet, I placed my fingers upon her pulse, and, whilst pretending to number it, accidentally, as it were, mentioned Jerry's name—the sudden thrill that pervaded the artery assured me that she loved — lifting my eyes to her face, I gave her an expressive look, which suffused her beauteous countenance, as if she was passing into the second stage of scarlet fever.</p>
      <p> My next duty was to seek Jerry. I found him seated on a log, under a shady willow by the edge of the bayou, pole in hand, assuming to be angling. The tense state of his line, and an occasional quiver of the pole, indicated that a fish was hooked. Passing unnoticed by him, a stranger would have come to one of three conclusions: that he was deranged, in love, or a born fool.</p>
      <p> Walking up to him briskly, without his hearing me, although I made considerable noise getting down the bank, I slapped him on the shoulder to engage his attention, and, as I had several patients to visit, and time was precious, without waiting for the usual salutations of the</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-181"/>
      <p> day, commenced my address in a real quarter race manner:—</p>
      <p> "Jerry, for a sensible man, and a fellow of courage, you are the d—dest fool and coward imhung. You love a girl—the girl loves you. You know that the old people are willing, and that the girl is only waiting for you to pop the question, to say 'Yes!' and yet, instead of having the thing over, like white folks, and becoming the head of a respectable family, here you sit, like a knot on a tree, with the moss commencing to grow on your back, pretending to be fishing, and yet not knowing that a big cat is almost breaking your line to shivers.</p>
      <p> " Now I want to do you a service, and you must take my advice. Jerk that fish out, take the hook out of his mouth, and then put him back in the bayou—perhaps his sweetheart was waiting for him when he got hung; and as you are in a like predicament, you should be able to say to the gal,  '  That mercy I to others show, that mercy show to me!' Go home, put on a clean shirt, shave that hair off your face and upper lip ; for a sensible woman never yet accepted a man, with nothing but the tip of his nose visible from its wilderness of hair. Dress yourself decently, go up to old Smith's, wait till you get rested, then ask the girl to take a walk in the garden—gardens are a h-11 of a place to make love in—to look at the flowers, to eat radishes, to pluck grapes—anything for an excuse to get her there—and when you have got her under the arbour, don't fall on your knees, or any of your fool novel notions, but stand straight up before her, take both of her hands in yours, look her dead in the eyes, and ask her, in a bold, manly way—as if you were pricing pork— to marry you. Will you do it.^ Speak quick! I'm interested in the matter, for if you don't do it to-day, by the Lord, I will, for mvself, to morrow. T haA'e held off for 15</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-182"/>
      <p> you long enough; and if you don't bring matters to a close, as I say, in the next twenty-four hours, as cold weather is coming on, I'll try my hand myself in the courting line—you know doctors are the very devil amongst the women !"</p>
      <p> This method of address alarmed Jerry, and he promised he would do as I directed.</p>
      <p> Accompanying him home, I saw him fairly dressed, and then left him, as the demands of my patients were urgent.</p>
      <p> Jerry mounted his steed, and set ofT at a brisk canter for Major Smith's. It was only a rnile and a half, and would have been travelled in a quarter of an hour, had the steed kept his gait.
