          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRECISELY
            at eight
            o'clock every morning
            except Saturdays and Sundays, Mademoiselle
            Suzanne St. Denys Godolph would
            cross the railroad trestle that spanned Bayou
            Boispourri. She might have crossed in the
            flat which Mr. Alphonse Laballière kept
            for his own convenience; but the method
            was slow and unreliable; so, every morning
            at eight, Mademoiselle St. Denys Godolph
            crossed the trestle.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She taught
            public school in a picturesque
            little white frame structure that stood upon
            Mr. Laballière's land, and hung upon the
            very brink of the bayou.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laballière
            himself was comparatively a
            new-comer in the parish. It was barely six
            months since he decided one day to leave
            the sugar and rice to his brother Alcée, who
            had a talent for their cultivation, and to try
            his hand at cotton-planting. That was why
            he was up in Natchitoches parish on a piece
            of rich, high, Cane River land, knocking
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf52"> Page 52</a>
          <p>
            into shape a tumbled-down plantation that
            he had bought for next to nothing.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had often
            during his perambulations
            observed the trim, graceful figure stepping
            cautiously over the ties, and had sometimes
            shivered for its safety. He always exchanged
            a greeting with the girl, and once
            threw a plank over a muddy pool for her to
            step upon. He caught but glimpses of her
            features, for she wore an enormous sun-bonnet
            to shield her complexion, that seemed
            marvelously fair; while loosely-fitting
            leather gloves protected her hands. He
            knew she was the school-teacher, and also
            that she was the daughter of that very
            pig-headed old Madame St. Denys Godolph
            who was hoarding her barren acres across
            the bayou as a miser hoards gold. Starving
            over them, some people said. But that was
            nonsense; nobody starves on a Louisiana
            plantation, unless it be with suicidal intent.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things
            he knew, but he did not
            know why Mademoiselle St. Denys Godolph
            always answered his salutation with an air
            of chilling hauteur that would easily have
            paralyzed a less sanguine man.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason
            was that Suzanne, like every
            one else, had heard the stories that were
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf53"> Page 53</a>
          <p>
            going the rounds about him. People said
            he was entirely too much at home with the
            free <font color="red">mulattoes</font>. <a href="#note2"
              n="2"><sup>1</sup></a> It
            seems a dreadful thing
            to say, and it would be a shocking thing to
            think of a Laballière; but it was n't true.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
            Laballière
            took possession of his
            land, he found the plantation-house occupied
            by one Giestin and his swarming family.
            It was past reckoning how long the free
            mulatto and his people had been there. The
            house was a six-room, long, shambling affair,
            shrinking together from decrepitude. There
            was not an entire pane of glass in the structure;
            and the Turkey-red curtains flapped in
            and out of the broken apertures. But there
            is no need to dwell upon details; it was
            wholly unfit to serve as a civilized human
            habitation; and Alphonse Laballière would
            no sooner have disturbed its contented
            occupants than he would have scattered a
            family of partridges nesting in a corner of
            his field. He established himself with a
            few belongings in the best cabin he could
            find on the place, and, without further ado,
            proceeded to supervise the building of house,
            <br>

              applied in
              Louisiana to mulattoes who
              were never in slavery, and whose families in most
              instances were themselves slave owners.

            of gin, of this, that, and the other, and to
            look into the hundred details that go to
            set a neglected plantation in good working
            order. He took his meals at the free
            mulatto's, quite apart from the family, of
            course; and they attended, not too skillfully,
            to his few domestic wants.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some loafer
            whom he had snubbed remarked
            one day in town that Laballière had
            more use for a free mulatto than he had
            for a white man. It was a sort of catching
            thing to say, and suggestive, and was repeated
            with the inevitable embellishments.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One morning
            when Laballière sat eating his
            solitary breakfast, and being waited
            upon by the queenly Madame Giestin and a
            brace of her weazened boys, Giestin himself
            came into the room. He was about half the
            size of his wife, puny and timid. He stood
            beside the table, twirling his felt hat aimlessly
            and balancing himself insecurely on his
            high-pointed boot-heels.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr.
            Laballière," he said, "I reckon I
            tell you; it 's betta you git shed o' me en'
            my fambly. Jis like you want, yas."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What in the
            name of common sense are you
            talking about?" asked Laballière, looking up
            abstractedly from his New Orleans paper.
            Giestin wriggled uncomfortably.</p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf55"> Page 55</a>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It 's heap
            o' story goin' roun' 'bout
            you, if you want b'lieve me." And he
            snickered and looked at his wife, who thrust
            the end of her shawl into her mouth and
            walked from the room with a tread like the
            Empress Eugenie's, in that elegant woman's
            palmiest days.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stories!"
            echoed Laballière, his face the
            picture of astonishment. "Who - where - what stories?"</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yon'a in
            town en' all about. It 's heap
            o' tale goin' roun', yas. They say how come
            you mighty fon' o' mulatta. You done shoshiate

            plantation, tell you can't res' lessen it 's
            mulatta roun' you."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laballière
            had a distressingly quick temper.
            His fist, which was a strong one, came down
            upon the wobbling table with a crash that sent
            half of Madame Giestin's crockery bouncing and
            crashing to the floor. He swore an oath that sent
            Madame Giestin and her father and
            grandmother, who were all listening in the next
            room, into suppressed convulsions of mirth.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, ho! so
            I 'm not to associate with whom I
            please in Natchitoches parish. We 'll see about
            that. Draw up your chair, Giestin.

            business is it but my own?"</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don'
            know, me. It 's jis like I tell
            you, Mr. Laballière," and Giestin selected
            a huge key from an assortment that hung
            against the wall, and left the room.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half hour
            later, Laballière had not yet
            recovered his senses. He appeared suddenly
            at the door of the schoolhouse, holding by
            the shoulder one of Giestin's boys.
            Mademoiselle St. Denys Godolph stood at
            the opposite extremity of the room. Her
            sunbonnet hung upon the wall, now, so
            Laballière could have seen how charming she was,
            had he not at the moment been blinded by
            stupidity. Her blue eyes that were fringed
            with dark lashes reflected astonishment at
            seeing him there. Her hair was dark like
            her lashes, and waved softly about her
            smooth, white forehead.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mademoiselle,"
            began Laballière at once,
            "I have taken the liberty of bringing a new
            pupil to you."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mademoiselle
            St. Denys Godolph paled

          <hr><a name="bayouf57"> Page 57</a>
          <p>
            suddenly and her voice was unsteady when
            she replied: - </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too
            considerate, Monsieur. Will
            you be so kine to give me the name of the
            scholar whom you desire to int'oduce into
            this school?" She knew it as well as he.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What 's
            your name, youngster? Out
            with it!" cried Laballière, striving to shake
            the little free mulatto into speech; but he
            stayed as dumb as a mummy.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His name is
            André Giestin. You know
            him. He is the son" -</p>
          <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then,
            Monsieur," she interrupted, "permit
            me to remine you that you have made a
            se'ious mistake. This is not a school conducted
            fo' the education of the colored population.
            You will have to go elsew'ere with yo'
            <em>protégé</em>."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I shall
            leave my <em>protégé</em> right here,
            Mademoiselle, and I trust you 'll give him
            the same kind attention you seem to accord
            to the others;" saying which <font color="red">Laballiere</font>
            bowed himself out of her presence. The little
            Giestin, left to his own devices, took only
            the time to give a quick, wary glance round
            the room, and the next instant he bounded
            through the open door, as the nimblest of
            four-footed creatures might have done.</p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mademoiselle
            St. Denys Godolph conducted
            school during the hours that remained,
            with a deliberate calmness that would have
            seemed ominous to her pupils, had they been
            better versed in the ways of young women.
            When the hour for dismissal came, she
            rapped upon the table to demand attention.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chil'ren,"
            she began, assuming a resigned
            and dignified mien, "you all have
            been witness to-day of the insult that has
            been offered to yo' teacher by the person
            upon whose lan' this schoolhouse stan's. I
            have nothing further to say on that subjec'.
            I only shall add that to-morrow yo' teacher
            shall sen' the key of this schoolhouse,
            together with her resignation, to the gentlemen
            who compose the school-boa'd." There
            followed visible disturbance among the
            young people.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ketch
            that li'le m'latta, I make 'im see
            sight', yas," screamed one.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing of
            the kine, Mathurin, you mus'
            take no such step, if only out of consideration
            fo' my wishes. The person who has
            offered the affront I consider beneath my
            notice. André, on the other han', is a chile
            of good impulse, an' by no means to blame.
            As you all perceive, he has shown mo' taste

            and judgment than those above him, f'om
            whom we might have expected good
            breeding, at least."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kissed
            them all, the little boys and
            the little girls, and had a kind word for
            each. "<i><em>Et toi, mon petit Numa, j'espère
                qu'un autre</em></i>" - She could not finish the
            sentence, for little Numa, her favorite, to
            whom she had never been able to impart
            the first word of English, was blubbering at
            a turn of affairs which he had only
            miserably guessed at.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She locked
            the schoolhouse door and
            walked away towards the bridge. By the
            time she reached it, the little 'Cadians had
            already disappeared like rabbits, down the
            road and through and over the fences.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mademoiselle
            St. Denys Godolph did not
            cross the trestle the following day, nor the
            next nor the next. Laballière watched for
            her; for his big heart was already sore and
            filled with shame. But more, it stung him
            with remorse to realize that he had been the
            stupid instrument in taking the bread, as it
            were, from the mouth of Mademoiselle St.
            Denys Godolph.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalled
            how unflinchingly and haughtily
            her blue eyes had challenged his own.
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf60"> Page 60</a>
          <p>
            Her sweetness and charm came back to him
            and he dwelt upon them and exaggerated
            them, till no Venus, so far unearthed, could
            in any way approach Mademoiselle St. Denys
            Godolph. He would have liked to
            exterminate the Giestin family, from the
            great-grandmother down to the babe unborn.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps
            Giesten suspected this unfavorable
            attitude, for one morning he piled his
            whole family and all his effects into wagons,
            and went away; over into that part of the
            parish known as <i><em>l'Isle des Mulâtres</em></i>.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laballière's
            really chivalrous nature told
            him, beside, that he owed an apology, at
            least, to the young lady who had taken his
            whim so seriously. So he crossed the bayou
            one day and penetrated into the wilds where
            Madame St. Denys Godolph ruled.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alluring
            little romance formed in his
            mind as he went; he fancied how easily it
            might follow the apology. He was almost
            in love with Mademoiselle St. Denys
            Godolph when he quitted his plantation. By
            the time he had reached hers, he was wholly
            so.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was met
            by Madame <em>mère</em>, a sweet-eyed,
            faded woman, upon whom old age had
            fallen too hurriedly to completely efface all
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf61"> Page 61</a>
          <p>
            traces of youth. But the house was old
            beyond question; decay had eaten slowly to
            the heart of it during the hours, the days,
            and years that it had been standing.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have come
            to see your daughter,
            madame," began Laballière, all too bluntly;
            for there is no denying he was blunt.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mademoiselle
            St. Denys Godolph is not
            presently at home, sir," madame replied.
            "She is at the time in New Orleans. She
            fills there a place of high trus' an'
            employment, Monsieur Laballière."</p>

            </div3></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suzanne
            had ever thought of New
            Orleans, it was always in connection with
            Hector Santien, because he was the only
            soul she knew who dwelt there. He had
            had no share in obtaining for her the
            position she had secured with one of the leading
            dry-goods firms; yet it was to him she
            addressed herself when her arrangements to
            leave home were completed.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not
            wait for her train to reach the
            city, but crossed the river and met her at
            Gretna. The first thing he did was to kiss
            her, as he had done eight years before when
            he left Natchitoches parish. An hour later
            he would no more have thought of kissing
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf62"> Page 62</a>
          <p>
            Suzanne than he would have tendered an
            embrace to the Empress of China. For by
            that time he had realized that she was no
            longer twelve nor he twenty-four.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could
            hardly believe the man who
            met her to be the Hector of old. His black
            hair was dashed with gray on the temples;
            he wore a short, parted beard and a small
            moustache that curled. From the crown of
            his glossy silk hat down to his trimly-gaitered
            feet, his attire was faultless. Suzanne
            knew her Natchitoches, and she had been to
            Shreveport and even penetrated as far as
            Marshall, Texas, but in all her travels she
            had never met a man to equal Hector in the
            elegance of his mien.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They entered
            a cab, and seemed to drive
            for an interminable time through the streets,
            mostly over cobble-stones that rendered
            conversation difficult. Nevertheless he talked
            incessantly, while she peered from the
            windows to catch what glimpses she could,
            through the night, of that New Orleans of
            which she had heard so much. The sounds
            were bewildering; so were the lights, that
            were uneven, too, serving to make the patches
            of alternating gloom more mysterious.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had not
            thought of asking him where
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf63"> Page 63</a>
          <p>
            he was taking her. And it was only after
            they crossed Canal and had penetrated some
            distance into Royal Street, that he told her.
            He was taking her to a friend of his, the
            dearest little woman in town. That was
            Maman Chavan, who was going to board
            and lodge her for a ridiculously small
            consideration.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maman Chavan
            lived within comfortable
            walking distance of Canal Street, on one of
            those narrow, intersecting streets between
            Royal and Chartres. Her house was a tiny,
            single-story one, with overhanging gable,
            heavily shuttered door and windows and
            three wooden steps leading down to the
            banquette. A small garden flanked it on one
            side, quite screened from outside view by a
            high fence, over which appeared the tops of
            orange trees and other luxuriant shrubbery.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was
            waiting for them - a lovable,
            fresh-looking, white-haired, black-eyed, small,
            fat little body, dressed all in black. She
            understood no English; which made no
            difference. Suzanne and Hector spoke but
            French to each other.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hector did
            not tarry a moment longer
            than was needed to place his young friend
            and charge in the older woman's care. He
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf64"> Page 64</a>
          <p>
            would not even stay to take a bite of supper
            with them. Maman Chavan watched him as
            he hurried down the steps and out into the
            gloom. Then she said to Suzanne: "That
            man is an angel, Mademoiselle, <i><em>un ange du
                bon Dieu</em></i>."</p>

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women, my
            dear Maman Chavan, you
            know how it is with me in regard to women.
            I have drawn a circle round my heart, so - at pretty long
            range, mind you - and there
            is not one who gets through it, or over it or
            under it."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i><em>Blagueur,
                va</em>!</i>" laughed Maman Chavan,
            replenishing her glass from the bottle
            of sauterne.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was
            Sunday morning. They were
            breakfasting together on the pleasant side
            gallery that led by a single step down to
            the garden. Hector came every Sunday
            morning, an hour or so before noon, to
            breakfast with them. He always brought a
            bottle of sauterne, a paté, or a mess of
            artichokes or some tempting bit of <i><em>charcuterie</em></i>.
            Sometimes he had to wait till the two women
            returned from hearing mass at the cathedral.
            He did not go to mass himself. They
            were both making a Novena on that account,
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf65"> Page 65</a>
          <p>
            and had even gone to the expense of
            burning a round dozen of candles before the
            good St. Joseph, for his conversion. When
            Hector accidentally discovered the fact, he
            offered to pay for the candles, and was
            distressed at not being permitted to do so.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suzanne had
            been in the city more than a
            month. It was already the close of February,
            and the air was flower-scented, moist,
            and deliciously mild.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As I said:
            women, my dear Maman
            Chavan " - </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us hear
            no more about women!"
            cried Suzanne, impatiently. "<i><em>Cher Maître</em>!</i>
            but Hector can be tiresome when he wants.
            Talk, talk; to say what in the end?"</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quite
            right, my cousin; when I might
            have been saying how charming you are this
            morning. But don't think that I have n't
            noticed it," and he looked at her with a
            deliberation that quite unsettled her. She took a
            letter from her pocket and handed it to him.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here, read
            all the nice things mamma
            has to say of you, and the love messages she
            sends to you." He accepted the several
            closely written sheets from her and began to
            look over them.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i><em>Ah,
                la bonne tante</em></i>," he laughed, when
          </p>

          <p>
            he came to the tender passages that referred
            to himself. He had pushed aside the glass
            of wine that he had only partly filled at
            the beginning of breakfast and that he had
            scarcely touched. Maman Chavan again
            replenished her own. She also lighted a
            cigarette. So did Suzanne, who was learning to
            smoke. Hector did not smoke; he did not
            use tobacco in any form, he always said to
            those who offered him cigars.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suzanne
            rested her elbows on the table,
            adjusted the ruffles about her wrists, puffed
            awkwardly at her cigarette that kept going
            out, and hummed the Kyrie Eleison that she
            had heard so beautifully rendered an hour
            before at the Cathedral, while she gazed off
            into the green depths of the garden. Maman
            Chavan slipped a little silver medal
            toward her, accompanying the action with a
            pantomime that Suzanne readily understood.
            She, in turn, secretly and adroitly transferred
            the medal to Hector's coat-pocket.
            He noticed the action plainly enough, but
            pretended not to.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natchitoches
            has n't changed," he
            commented. "The everlasting <i><em>can-cans</em>!</i>
            when will they have done with them? This
            is n't little Athénaîse Miché, getting married!

          <p>
            <i><em>Sapristi</em>!</i> but it makes one old! And old
            Papa Jean-Pierre only dead now? I thought
            he was out of purgatory five years ago. And
            who is this Laballière? One of the
            Laballières of St. James?"</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"St. James,
            <i><em>mon cher</em></i>. Monsieur
            Alphonse Laballière; an aristocrat from the
            'golden coast.' But it is a history, if you
            will believe me. <i><em>Figurez vous</em></i>, Maman
            Chavan, - <i> <em>pensez donc, mon ami</em></i>" - And
            with much dramatic fire, during which the
            cigarette went irrevocably out, she proceeded
            to narrate her experiences with Laballière.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible!"
            exclaimed Hector when
            the climax was reached; but his indignation
            was not so patent as she would have liked it
            to be.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And to
            think of an affront like that
            going unpunished!" was Maman Chavan's
            more sympathetic comment.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, the
            scholars were only too ready to
            offer violence to poor little André, but that,
            you can understand, I would not permit.
            And now, here is mamma gone completely
            over to him; entrapped, God only knows
            how!"</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes,"
            agreed Hector, "I see he has been
            sending her tamales and <i><em>boudin blanc</em></i>."</p>

                blanc</em></i>, my friend! If it were
            only that! But I have a stack of letters, so
            high, - I could show them to you, - singing
            of Laballière, Laballière, enough to
            drive one distracted. He visits her
            constantly. He is a man of attainment, she
            says, a man of courage, a man of heart; and
            the best of company. He has sent her a
            bunch of fat robins as big as a tub" - </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is
            something in that - a good
            deal in that, <em>mignonne</em>," piped Maman
            Chavan, approvingly.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now <i><em>boudin
                blanc</em>!</i> and she tells
            me it is the duty of a Christian to forgive.
            Ah, no; it 's no use; mamma's ways are past
            finding out."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suzanne was
            never in Hector's company
            elsewhere than at Maman Chavan's. Beside
            the Sunday visit, he looked in upon them
            sometimes at dusk, to chat for a moment or
            two. He often treated them to theatre tickets,
            and even to the opera, when business
            was brisk. Business meant a little notebook
            that he carried in his pocket, in which
            he sometimes dotted down orders from the
            country people for wine, that he sold on
            commission. The women always went
            together, unaccompanied by any male escort;
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf69"> Page 69</a>
          <p>
            trotting along, arm in arm, and brimming
            with enjoyment.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That same
            Sunday afternoon Hector
            walked with them a short distance when
            they were on their way to vespers. The three
            walking abreast almost occupied the narrow
            width of the banquette. A gentleman who
            had just stepped out of the Hotel Royal
            stood aside to better enable them to pass.
            He lifted his hat to Suzanne, and cast a quick
            glance, that pictured stupefaction and wrath,
            upon Hector.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It 's he!"
            exclaimed the girl, melodramatically
            seizing Maman Chavan's arm.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who, he?"</p>
          <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Laballière!"</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A handsome
            fellow, all the same," nodded
            the little lady, approvingly. Hector
            thought so too. The conversation again
            turned upon Laballière, and so continued
            till they reached the side door of the cathedral,
            where the young man left his two
            companions.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
            evening Laballière called upon
            Suzanne. Maman Chavan closed the front
            door carefully after he entered the small
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf70"> Page 70</a>
          <p>
            parlor, and opened the side one that looked
            into the privacy of the garden. Then she
            lighted the lamp and retired, just as Suzanne
            entered.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl
            bowed a little stiffly, if it may be
            said that she did anything stiffly.
            "Monsieur Laballière." That was all she said.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mademoiselle
            St. Denys Godolph," and
            that was all he said. But ceremony did not
            sit easily upon him.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mademoiselle,"
            he began, as soon as
            seated, "I am here as the bearer of a
            message from your mother. You must
            understand that otherwise I would not be here."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do
            understan', sir, that you an' maman
            have become very warm frien's during my
            absence," she returned, in measured,
            conventional tones.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It pleases
            me immensely to hear that
            from you," he responded, warmly; "to
            believe that Madame St. Denys Godolph is
            my friend."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suzanne
            coughed more affectedly than
            was quite nice, and patted her glossy braids.
            "The message, if you please, Mr.
            Laballière."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be
            sure," pulling himself together
            from the momentary abstraction into which
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf71"> Page 71</a>
          <p>
            he had fallen in contemplating her. "Well,
            it 's just this; your mother, you must know,
            has been good enough to sell me a fine bit
            of land - a deep strip along the bayou" -</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible!
            <i><em>Mais</em></i> w'at sorcery did you
            use to obtain such a thing of my mother,
            Mr. Laballiere? Lan' that has been in the
            St. Denys Godolph family since time
            untole!"</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No sorcery
            whatever, Mademoiselle, only
            an appeal to your mother's intelligence and
            common sense; and she is well supplied with
            both. She wishes me to say, further, that
            she desires your presence very urgently and
            your immediate return home."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mother
            is unduly impatient, surely,"
            replied Suzanne, with chilling politeness.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May I ask,
            mademoiselle," he broke in,
            with an abruptness that was startling, "the
            name of the man with whom you were
            walking this afternoon?"</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked
            at him with unaffected
            astonishment, and told him: "I hardly
            understan' yo' question. That gentleman is Mr.
            Hector Santien, of one of the firs' families
            of Natchitoches; a warm ole frien' an' far
            distant relative of mine."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, that 's
            his name, is it, Hector Santien?
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf72"> Page 72</a>
          <p>
            Well, please don't walk on the New
            Orleans streets again with Mr. Hector
            Santien."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yo' remarks
            would be insulting if they
            were not so highly amusing, Mr.
            Laballiere."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I beg your
            pardon if I am insulting;
            and I have no desire to be amusing," and
            then Laballière lost his head. "You are at
            liberty to walk the streets with whom you
            please, of course," he blurted, with
            ill-suppressed passion, "but if I encounter
            Mr. Hector Santien in your company again,
            in public, I shall wring his neck, then and
            there, as I would a chicken; I shall break
            every bone in his body" - Suzanne had
            arisen.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have
            said enough, sir. I even
            desire no explanation of yo' words."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did n't
            intend to explain them," he
            retorted, stung by the insinuation.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will
            escuse me further," she
            requested icily, motioning to retire.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not till -
            oh, not till you have forgiven
            me," he cried impulsively, barring her exit;
            for repentance had come swiftly this time.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she did
            not forgive him. "I can
            wait," she said. Then he stepped aside and
            she passed by him without a second glance.
          </p>

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sent
            word to Hector the following
            day to come to her. And when he was
            there, in the late afternoon, they walked
            together to the end of the vine-sheltered
            gallery, - where the air was redolent with the
            odor of spring blossoms.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hector,"
            she began, after a while, "some
            one has told me I should not be seen upon
            the streets of New Orleans with you."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was
            trimming a long rose-stem with
            his sharp penknife. He did not stop nor
            start, nor look embarrassed, nor anything of
            the sort.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Indeed!" he
            said.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, you
            know," she went on, "if the
            saints came down from heaven to tell me
            there was a reason for it, I could n't believe
            them."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You would
            n't believe them, <i><em>ma petite
                Suzanne</em>?</i>" He was getting all the thorns
            off nicely, and stripping away the heavy
            lower leaves.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want you
            to look me in the face,
            Hector, and tell me if there is any reason."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snapped
            the knife-blade and replaced
            the knife in his pocket; then he looked in
            her eyes, so unflinchingly, that she hoped
            and believed it presaged a confession of
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf74"> Page 74</a>
          <p>
            innocence that she would gladly have accepted.
            But he said indifferently: "Yes, there are
            reasons."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I say
            there are not," she exclaimed
            excitedly; "you are amusing yourself - laughing at me, as
            you always do.
            There are no reasons that I will hear or
            believe. You will walk the streets with me,
            will you not, Hector?" she entreated, "and
            go to church with me on Sunday; and, and - oh, it 's
            nonsense, nonsense for you to
            say things like that!"</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held the
            rose by its long, hardy stem,
            and swept it lightly and caressingly across
            her forehead, along her cheek, and over her
            pretty mouth and chin, as a lover might
            have done with his lips. He noticed how
            the red rose left a crimson stain behind it.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had been
            standing, but now she sank
            upon the bench that was there, and buried
            her face in her palms. A slight convulsive
            movement of the muscles indicated a
            suppressed sob.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah,
            Suzanne, Suzanne, you are not
            going to make yourself unhappy about a <i><em>bon
                à rien</em></i> like me. Come, look at me; tell me
            that you are not." He drew her hands
            down from her face and held them a while,
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf75"> Page 75</a>
          <p>
            bidding her good-by. His own face wore
            the quizzical look it often did, as if he were
            laughing at her.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That work
            at the store is telling on
            your nerves, <i><em>mignonne</em></i>. Promise me that
            you will go back to the country. That will
            be best."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes; I
            am going back home,
            Hector."</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is
            right, little cousin," and he patted
            her hands kindly, and laid them both
            down gently into her lap.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not
            return; neither during the
            week nor the following Sunday. Then
            Suzanne told Maman Chavan she was going
            home. The girl was not too deeply in love
            with Hector; but imagination counts for
            something, and so does youth.</p>

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laballière
            was on the train with her. She
            felt, somehow, that he would be. And yet
            she did not dream that he had watched and
            waited for her each morning since he parted
            from her.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to
            her without preliminary of
            manner or speech, and held out his hand;
            she extended her own unhesitatingly. She
            could not understand why, and she was a
          </p>
          <hr><a name="bayouf76"> Page 76</a>
          <p>
            little too weary to strive to do so. It
            seemed as though the sheer force of his will
            would carry him to the goal of his wishes.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not
            weary her with attentions during
            the time they were together. He sat
            apart from her, conversing for the most time
            with friends and acquaintances who belonged
            in the sugar district through which
            they traveled in the early part of the day.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wondered
            why he had ever left that
            section to go up into Natchitoches. Then
            she wondered if he did not mean to speak
            to her at all. As if he had read the thought,
            he went and sat down beside her.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He showed
            her, away off across the country,
            where his mother lived, and his brother
            Alcée, and his cousin Clarisse.</p>

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday
            morning, when Maman Chavan
            strove to sound the depth of Hector's
            feeling for Suzanne, he told her again:
            "Women, my dear Maman Chavan, you
            know how it is with me in regard to women," - and he
            refilled her glass from the bottle
            of sauterne.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i><em>Farceur
                va</em>!</i>" and Maman Chavan
            laughed, and her fat shoulders quivered
            under the white <i><em>volante</em></i> she wore.

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A day or two
            later, Hector was walking
            down Canal Street at four in the afternoon.
            He might have posed, as he was, for a
            fashion-plate. He looked not to the right
            nor to the left; not even at the women who
            passed by. Some of them turned to look
            at him.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he
            approached the corner of Royal,
            a young man who stood there nudged his
            companion.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know
            who that is?" he said,
            indicating Hector.</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No; who?"</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you
            are an innocent. Why, that 's
            Deroustan, the most notorious gambler in
            New Orleans."</p>
