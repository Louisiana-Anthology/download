<p><b>Sample Poems by Gail White</b><hr>
<p><b>Housecleaner</b></p>
<p>My mother harried balls of dust<br />
  From under sofas, tables, chairs,<br />
  Bits of paper, single hairs,<br />
  All were gathered in her lust<br />
  For a desperate cleanliness.<br />
  Now serene I face the mess<br />
  I live in, safe with mold and must,<br />
  Storing in my attic head<br />
  All the lint and thread and fuzz<br />
  Gathered in a past I&rsquo;ve shed<br />
  From the dust my mother was.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>My Personal Recollections of Not Being Asked to the Prom</b></p>
<p>I never minded my unpopularity<br />
  in those days. Books were friends and poets (dead)<br />
  were lovers. Brainy girls were still a rarity, <br />
  and boys preferred big bosoms to well read<br />
  and saucy wits. I look back now with pity <br />
  on the young Me I didn&rsquo;t pity them.<br />
  I didn&rsquo;t know that I was almost pretty<br />
  And might have had a charm for older men.</p>
<p>And my poor mom, who never bought a fluffy<br />
  ball gown or showed me how to dress my hair&mdash;<br />
  she must have wondered where she got this stuffy<br />
  daughter. She didn&rsquo;t say it, but her stare <br />
  asked whether genes or nurture were to blame.<br />
  (But I got married, Mother, all the same).</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Breaking Down in the South</b></p>
<p>It knocked me over to learn there&rsquo;s no such thing<br />
  as a nervous breakdown. My aunts and uncles had them<br />
  all the time. It was spoken of in whispers, <br />
  like drink, divorce, or cancer. Aunt Leona <br />
  had a Nervous Breakdown back in &lsquo;67<br />
  and never took communion again&mdash;she thought<br />
  the devil had her. Enviable Aunt Leona,<br />
  sure of her standing with the Lord and Satan.<br />
  Uncle Eugene got violent when he drank<br />
  and ended up in a Home. They never said<br />
  whose home it was. Some people who broke down <br />
  looked fine to me, but still the fame and glamour <br />
  of a Nervous Breakdown hung around their necks<br />
  like a name-brand diamond. Now, in middle age, <br />
  I&rsquo;m told my dismal state is just depression,<br />
  Reactive, mild&mdash;here, try a little Prozac.<br />
  Damn it, I don&rsquo;t want drugs. I only want <br />
  to be eccentric, batty, somewhat daft, <br />
  covered by Aunt Leona&rsquo;s mental mist.<br />
  Again, my generation gets the shaft.<br />
  I&rsquo;m due for a breakdown, and they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>For My Niece as She Enters Her Teens</b></p>
<p>One thing the Puritans were right about:<br />
  Children are savages. They have no mind<br />
  or morals, and their art-work doesn&rsquo;t count.<br />
  But now, thank God, you leave all that behind<br />
  and count as almost human&mdash;golden ore<br />
  that only wants a little smoothing down.<br />
  So now, the news flash you&rsquo;ve been waiting for:<br />
  Your aunt and uncle didn&rsquo;t come to town<br />
  on a load of melons. We discovered sex<br />
  without your help; we drove our elders wild <br />
  with music, alcohol, and politics,<br />
  and wore our hair as long as yours, my child.<br />
  So don&rsquo;t suppose you understand pop culture<br />
  when you don&rsquo;t even know who Pogo was.<br />
  The Beatles aren&rsquo;t yet ready for the mulcher.<br />
  I still know several ways to get a buzz,<br />
  the Buddhist creed, and how to write free verse.<br />
  Your generation, love, could do much worse.</p>
